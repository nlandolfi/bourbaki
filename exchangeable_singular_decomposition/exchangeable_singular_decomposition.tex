\stitle{Exchangeable-Singular Decomposition}

\ssection{Why}

Suppose a measure is not
exchangeable with another.
Then what.
We can separate out the
troublsome piece;
perhaps it can be handled
separately.

\ssection{Result}

\begin{prop}


Let $(X, \SA)$ be a measurable space.
Let $\mu$ be a measure on $(X, \SA)$.
Let $\nu$ be a finite signed measure
or complex measure or $\sigma$-finite
measure on $(X, \SA)$. There there is
a unique decomposition $\nu = \nu_a + \nu_s$
where $\nu_a \ll \mu$ and $\nu_s \perp \mu$.
\end{prop}

The above is also called
\ct{Lebesgue's Decomposition Theorem}{}.
