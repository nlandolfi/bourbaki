<h1 id='Why'>Why</h1>

<p>
 <span class='run'>We want to talk about an algorithm which can
  learn from a hypothesis class, regardless of the
  underlying distribution.</span>
</p>

<span class='run'> <h1 id='Definition'>Definition</h1>
</span>
<p>
 <span class='run'>Let $(X, \mathcal{X} )$ and $(Y, \mathcal{Y} )$
  be measurable input and output spaces.</span>
</p>


<p>
 <span class='run'>A hypothesis class $\mathcal{H} $ of measurable
  functions from $X$ to $Y$ is
  <span class='term'>probably approximately correct
  learnable</span> (or <span class='term'>PAC
  learnable</span>) if</span>

 <span class='run'>(a) there exists an inductor $\mathcal{A} : (X
  \times  Y)^n \to \mathcal{H} $, so that (b) for
  every underlying measure $\mu $ and labeling
  function $f: X \to Y$ (c) for every $\epsilon ,
  \delta  \in (0, 1)$ (d) there exists $m_0 \in
  \N  $ so that (e) for all $m \geq m_0$
  <p>\[
   \mu ^m\left[

   \mu \left[

   \mathcal{A} ((x_i, f(x_i))_{i = 1}^{n})(\xi ) \neq f(\xi )

   \right]

   \leq \epsilon  \right] \geq 1-\delta
  \]</p>
  where $x \in X^m$ and $\xi  \in X$.</span>

 <span class='run'>In this case we say that the inductor (or
  learning algorithm) $\mathcal{A} $
  <span class='term'>PAC learns</span> $\mathcal{H} $.</span>
</p>


<p>
 <span class='run'>We interpret this as follows: “no matter the
  underlying distribution and correct labeling
  function, if someone specifies an accuracy and
  confidence we can tell them the number of
  samples they need so that the inductor outputs
  a hypothesis which is probably approximately
  correct.”</span>
</p>


<p>
 <span class='run'>Some authors require that the hypothesis class
  be realizable with respect to the underlying
  distribution and correct labeling function.</span>

 <span class='run'>This is natural, because if the hypothesis
  class includes the correct labeling function $f$,
  then it is realizable.</span>

 <span class='run'>In this case they refer to the above
  definition as the <span class='term'>agnostic PAC
  model</span>.</span>

 <span class='run'>We emphasize here that there this definition
  includes the notion of realizability.</span>

 <span class='run'>In other words.</span>

 <span class='run'>We emphasize again that this definition contains
  to “approximation parameters.”</span>

 <span class='run'>The accuracy parameter $\epsilon $ corresponds to
  the “approximately correct” piece and the
  confidence parameters $\delta $ corresponds to the
  “probably” piece.</span>
</p>

<h2 id='Sample_complexity'>Sample complexity</h2>

<p>
 <span class='run'>Note that the existence of an $m_0$ above for
  each $\epsilon $ and $\delta $ is equivalent to
  requiring that there exists $m_0: (0, 1)^2 \to
  \N$ so that for all $m \geq
  m_0(\epsilon ,\delta )$ the condition in the above
  equation holds.</span>

 <span class='run'>There may exist multiple such $m_0$, so we
  define $\tilde{m}: (0, 1)^2 \to \N  $ so that
  $\tilde{m}(\epsilon ,\delta )$ is the smallest
  integer so that the above equation holds.</span>

 <span class='run'>We call $\tilde{m}$ the <span class='term'>sample
  complexity</span>.</span>

 <span class='run'>Clearly it is a function of $\epsilon $ and
  $\delta $.</span>

 <span class='run'>It also depends on the hypothesis class
  $\mathcal{H} $ and the learning algorithm
  $\mathcal{A} $.</span>
