Why</h1></div><div class="sheet-listing"><p class="sheet"> We give some examples of objects and sets.</p></div><div class="sheet-listing" id="examples"><h1 class="sheet">2. Examples</h1></div><div class="sheet-listing"><p class="sheet"> For familiar examples, let us start with some tangible objects. Find, or call to mind, a deck of playing cards.</p></div><div class="sheet-listing"><p class="sheet"> First, consider the set of all the cards. This set contains fifty-two elements. Second, consider the set of cards whose suit is hearts. This set contains thirteen elements: the ace, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, jack, queen, and king of hearts. Third, consider the set of twos. This set contains four elements: the two of clubs, the two of spades, the two of hearts, and the two of diamonds.</p></div><div class="sheet-listing"><p class="sheet"> We can imagine many more sets of cards. If we are holding a deck, each of these can be made tangible: we can touch the elements of the set. But the set itself is always abstract: we can not touch it. It is the idea of the group as distinct from any individual member.</p></div><div class="sheet-listing"><p class="sheet"> Moreover, the elements of a set need not be tangible. First, consider the set consisting of the suits of the playing card: hearts, diamonds, spades, and clubs. This set has four elements. Each element is a suit.</p></div><div class="sheet-listing"><p class="sheet"> Second, consider the set consisting of the card types. This set has thirteen elements: ace, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, jack, queen, king. The subtlety here is that this set is different than the set of hearts, namely those thirteen cards which are hearts. However these sets are similar: they both have thirteen elements, and there is a natural correspondence between their elements: the ace of hearts with the type ace, the two of hearts with the type two, and so on.</p></div><div class="sheet-listing"><p class="sheet"> Of course, sets need have nothing to do with playing cards. For example, consider the set of seasons: autumn, winter, spring, and summer. This set has four elements. For another example, consider the set of Latin letters: a, b, c, \dots, x, y, z. This set has twenty-six elements.</p></div>
