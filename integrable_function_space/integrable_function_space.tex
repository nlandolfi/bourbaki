\stitle{Integrable Function Space}

\ssection{Why}

We have seen that
the linear combination
of integrable functions
is integrable.
Thus, the integrable
functions are a vector
space.

\ssection{Definition}

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(X, \SA, \mu)$
be a measure space.
Let $R$ denote
the set of real numbers
and let $C$ denote
the set of complex numbers.
We denote set the
real-valued integrable
functions on $X$
by $\intgrbl(X, \SA, \mu, R)$.
We denote set the
complex-valued integrable
functions on $X$
by $\intgrbl(X, \SA, \mu, C)$.
When the field is irrelevant,
we denote them by $\intgrbl(X, \SA, \mu)$.
