      <h1>Sets</h1>

      <h2>Why</h2>

      <p>
        We want to talk
        about none, one, or
        several objects considered
        as a whole,
        for which we will use
        the word <i>set</i>.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition</h2>

      <p>
        A <b>set</b> is an abstract
        object which we think of as
        several objects considered
        at once.
        We say that the set
        <b>contains</b>
        the objects so considered.
        We call these
        the
        <b>elements</b> of the set.
      </p>

    <p>
        We call the set which contains
        no objects the
        \ct{empty set}{emptyset}.
        We call
        a set which contains
        only a single object a
        \ct{singleton}{singleton}.
        A singleton is not the
        same as the object
        it contains.
        Besides these two cases,
        we think of sets
        as containing
        two or more objects.
      </p>

      <p>
        The objects a set contains
        may be other sets.
        This may be subtle at
        first glance, but becomes
        familiar with experience.
      </p>

      <h3> Notation </h3>


      <p>
        Let us tend to
        denote sets by
        upper case Latin letters:
        for example,
        $A$, $B$, and $C$.
        To aid our memory,
        let us tend to use the lower
        case form of the letter for
        an element of the set.
        For example,
        let $A$ and $B$ be
        non-empty sets.
        Let us tend to denote by
        $a$ an element of $A$,
        and likewise,
        by $b$ an element of $B$
      </p>

      <p>
        Let us denote that
        an object $a$
        is an element of a set $A$
        by $a \in A$.
        We read the notation
        $a \in A$ aloud as \say{a in A.}
        The $\in$ is a stylized
        lower case Greek letter: $\epsilon$.
        It is
        read aloud \say{ehp-sih-lawn} and
        is a mnemonic for \say{element of}.
        We write $a \not\in A$, read aloud
        as \say{a not in A,} if $a$ is not
        an element of $A$.
      <p>

  If we have named
  the elements of a set,
  and can list them,
  let us do so between braces.
  For example,
  let $a$, $b$, and $c$
  be three distinct objects.
  Denote by $\set{a, b, c}$
  the set containing theses
  three objects and only these
  three objects.
  We can further compress notation,
  and denote this set of
  three objects by $A$:
  so, $A = \set{a, b, c}$.
  Then $a \in A$,
  $b \in A$, and $c \in A$.
  Moreover, if $d$
  is an object and
  $d \in A$, then $d = a$
  or $d = b$ or $d = c$.

  We denote the empty set
  by $\emptyset$.
  Note that
  $\emptyset \neq \set{\emptyset}$.
  The left hand side, $\emptyset$,
  is the empty set.
  The right hand side, $\set{\emptyset}$, is
  the singleton whose element
  is the empty set.
  We distinguish the set
  containing one element from the
  element itself.
