<h2>Why</h1><p>We use the language
of measure theory
to give a mathematical model
for uncertain outcomes.
TODO: probability
intuition sheet.</p><h2>Definition</h1><p>A
\ct{probability measure}
is a finite measure on
a measurable space
which assigns the
value one to the base set.
Since a finite measure
can always be scaled to
a probability measure,
these measures are
standard examples of
finite measures.<p>A
<b>probability space</b>
is a measure space
whose measure is a
probability measure.
The <b>outcomes</b>
of a probability space
are the elements
of the base set.
The <b>set of outcomes</b>
is the base set.
The <b>events</b> are the
elements of the sigma algebra.</p><h3>Notation</h3><p>We denote the
set of outcomes by
$\Omega$,
a mnemonic for
"outcomes."
We denote the
sigma-algebra by
$\SA$,
as usual.
We denote a probability
measure
by $\pmeas$, a mnemonic
for "probability."
Thus, we often say
\say{Let
$(\Omega, \SA, \pmeas)$
be a probability space.}</p><h3>Properties</h3>
