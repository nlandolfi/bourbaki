<h2>Why</h1><p>We want a notion for a correspondence
between two sets.</p><h2>Definition</h1><p>A <b>functional</b> relation
on two sets relates each element of the
first set with a unique element of the
second set.
A <b>function</b> is a
functional \rt{relation}{relation}.<p>The <b>domain</b> of the function is
the first set and <b>codomain</b>
of the function is the second set.
The \rt{function}{function}
<b>maps</b> elements
<b>from</b> the
\rt{domain}{domain} <b>to</b>
the \rt{codomain}{codomain}.
We call the codomain element associated
with the domain element the
<b>result</b> of
<b>applying</b>
the function to the domain element.</p><h3>Notation</h3><p>Let $A$ and $B$ be sets.
If $A$ is the domain and $B$ the codomain,
we denote the set of functions from $A$ to
$B$ by $A \to B$, read aloud as "A to B".<p>We denote functions by lower case latin letters,
especially $f$, $g$, and $h$.
The letter $f$ is a mnemonic for
\rt{function}{function};
$g$ and $h$ follow $f$ in the Latin alphabet.
We denote that $f \in A \to B$ by
$f: A \to B$, read aloud as
"f from A to B".<p>Let $f: A \to B$.
For each element $a \in A$, we denote the
result of applying
$f$ to $a$ by $f(a)$, read aloud
"f of a."
We sometimes drop the parentheses, and write
the result as $f_a$, read aloud as
"f sub a."<p>Let $g: A \times B \to C$.
We often write $g(a,b)$ or $g_{ab}$
instead of $g((a,b))$.
We read $g(a, b)$ aloud as
"g of a and b".
We read $g_{ab}$ aloud as
"g sub a b."</p></div>
