<h2>Why</h1><p>We want to generalize the
construction of cover area
as generated as a product
of two cover lengths, and more
generally for arbitrary
measure spaces.
TODO</p><h2>Definition</h1><p>Consider two measurable spaces.
The <b>product base set</b> is
the cartesian product of
the first base set with
the second base set.
A first distinguished set
is a distinguished set
of the first measurable space,
and likewise for a second distinguished set.<p>A
\ct{rectangle
with measurable sides}
{rectanglewithmeasurablesides}
is a set in product base set
which is
a product of a first
distinguished set with a second
distinguished set.
The
\ct{product sigma
algebra}
{product sigma algebra}
is the sigma algebra
generated by the rectangles
with measurable sides.<p>The <b>product measurable space</b>
is the measurable space
whose base set is the product
base set and whose sigma algebra
is the product sigma algebra.</p><h3>Notation</h3>
Let
$(X, \SA)$ and $(Y, \SB)$
be measurable spaces.
The product base set is
$X \cross Y$.
A set
$R \in X \cross Y$
is a rectangle with measurable
sides if $R = A \cross B$ for
$A \in \SA$ and $B \in \SB$.
We denote the product sigma algebra
of $\SA$ and $\SB$ by $\SA \cross \SB$.
$(X \cross Y, \SA \cross \SB)$ is
the product measurable space.</p></div>
