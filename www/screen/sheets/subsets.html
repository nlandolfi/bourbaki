<h2>Why</h1><p>We want to speak
of sets which contain
all the elements of
other sets.</p><h2>Two Sets</h1><p>A
<b>subset</b>
of a set $A$ is any set $B$ for
which each element of the set $B$
is an element of the set $A$.
In this case, we say that
$B$ is a subset of $A$.
Conversely, we say that
$A$ is a <b>superset</b> of $B$.<p>Every set is a subset of itself.
So if the set $A$ is the set $B$,
then $A$ is a subset of $B$
and $B$ is a subset of $A$.
Conversely, if $A$ is a
subset of $B$ and $B$ is
a subset of $A$, then $A$ is $B$.
To argue that $A$ is $B$,
we argue that
membership in $A$ implies membership in $B$
and second, we argue that membership in $B$
implies membership in $A$.
<p>The <b>power set</b>
of a set is the set of all subsets of that
set.
It includes the set itself and the empty set.
We call these two sets
<b>improper subsets</b>
of the set.
We call all other sets
<b>proper subsets</b>.</p>
<h3>Notation</h3>
Let $A$ and $B$ be sets.
We denote that $A$ is a subset of $B$ by $A \subset B$.
We read the notation $A \subset B$ aloud as "A subset B".<p>If $A \subset B$ and $B \subset A$, then $A = B$.
The converse also holds.<p>We denote the power set of $A$ by $\powerset{A}$, read aloud as "two to the A."
$A \in \powerset{A}$ and $\emptyset \in \powerset{A}$.
However, $A \subset \powerset{A}$ is false.</p><h3>Examples</h3><p>Let $a, b, c$ be distinct
objects. Let $A = \set{a, b ,c}$
and $B = \set{a, b}$. Then
$B \subset A$.
In other notation,
$B \in \powerset{A}$.
As always, $\emptyset \in \powerset{A}$
and $A \in \powerset{A}$ as well.
In this case, we can
list the elements (which are sets)
of the power set:
\[
  \powerset{A} = \set{
    \emptyset,
    \set{a},
    \set{b},
    \set{c},
    \set{a, b},
    \set{b, c},
    \set{a, c},
    \set{a, b, c}
  }.
