<h2>Why</h1><p>We want to talk
about none, one, or
several objects considered
as a whole,
for which we will use
the word <i>set</i>.</p><h2>Definition</h1><p>A <b>set</b> is an abstract
object which we think of as
several objects considered
at once.
We say that the set
<b>contains</b>
the objects so considered.
We call these
the
<b>elements</b> of the set.<p>We call the set which contains
no objects the
<b>empty set</b>.
We call
a set which contains
only a single object a
<b>singleton</b>.
A singleton is not the
same as the object
it contains.
Besides these two cases,
we think of sets
as containing
two or more objects.<p>The objects a set contains
may be other sets.
This may be subtle at
first glance, but becomes
familiar with experience.</p><h3>Notation</h3><p>Let us tend to
denote sets by
upper case Latin letters:
for example,
$A$, $B$, and $C$.
To aid our memory,
let us tend to use the lower
case form of the letter for
an element of the set.
For example,
let $A$ and $B$ be
non-empty sets.
Let us tend to denote by
$a$ an element of $A$,
and likewise,
by $b$ an element of $B$<p>Let us denote that
an object $a$
is an element of a set $A$
by $a \in A$.
We read the notation
$a \in A$ aloud as "a in A."
The $\in$ is a stylized
lower case Greek letter: $\epsilon$.
It is
read aloud "ehp-sih-lawn" and
is a mnemonic for "element of".
We write $a \not\in A$, read aloud
as "a not in A," if $a$ is not
an element of $A$.<p>If we have named
the elements of a set,
and can list them,
let us do so between braces.
For example,
let $a$, $b$, and $c$
be three distinct objects.
Denote by $\set{a, b, c}$
the set containing theses
three objects and only these
three objects.
We can further compress notation,
and denote this set of
three objects by $A$:
so, $A = \set{a, b, c}$.
Then $a \in A$,
$b \in A$, and $c \in A$.
Moreover, if $d$
is an object and
$d \in A$, then $d = a$
or $d = b$ or $d = c$.<p>We denote the empty set
by $\emptyset$.
Note that
$\emptyset \neq \set{\emptyset}$.
The left hand side, $\emptyset$,
is the empty set.
The right hand side, $\set{\emptyset}$, is
the singleton whose element
is the empty set.
We distinguish the set
containing one element from the
element itself.</p>
