<h2>Why</h1><p>We want to count, forever.</p><h2>Definition</h1>
<p>We define the set of <b>natural numbers</b>
implicitly.
There is an element of the set which we call
<b>one</b>.
For each element of the set,
there is a unique corresponding element, called the
<b>successor</b> of the former, which is
also in the set.
We call the elements <b>numbers</b> and call
the set itself the <b>naturals</b>.<p>The
<b>successor function</b>
is the correspondence between elements
of the natural numbers and their successors.
Its domain and codomain is the set of natural numbers.
It is a one-to-one correspondence.
It is not onto, however, since the element one
has no successor.<p>To recap, we begin with a distinguished element,
called \rt{one}{naturalone}, in the set.
There is a second element, the successor
of one, in the set.
We call the \rt{successor}{naturalsuccessor} of
\rt{one}{naturalone} <b>two</b>.
We call the \rt{successor}{naturalsuccessor} of
\rt{two}{naturaltwo} <b>three</b>.
And so on using the English language in the usual manner.
We are saying, in the language of sets, that the essence
of counting is starting with one and adding one repeatedly.</p><h3>Notation</h3><p>We denote the set of natural numbers by $N$, a mnemonic for natural.
We often denote elements of $N$ by $n$, a mnemonic for number, or $m$, a letter close to $n$.
We denote the element called one by $1$.</p>
