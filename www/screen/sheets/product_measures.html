<h2>Why</h1><p>We want to generalize the
construction of cover area
as generated as a product
of two cover lengths, and more
generally for arbitrary
measure spaces.
TODO</p><h2>Definition</h1><p>The
<b>product measure</b>
of the measures of two
sigma finite measure spaces
is the unique measure
which assigns to every
rectangle with measurable
sides the product
of the measures of the sides.
We prove that such a measure exists,
and is unique.</p>
<h3>Defining Result</h3><p>\begin{prop}
Let $(X, \SA, \mu)$
and $(Y, \SB, \nu)$
be sigma-finite
measurable spaces.
There is a unique
measure $\pi$
on $\SA \cross \SB$
such that
\[
  \pi(A \cross B) = \mu(A) \cross \nu(B)
\]
for all $A \in \SA$ and $B \in \SB$.
Furthermore, for any $E \in \SA \cross \SB$.
\[
  \pi(E) = \int_{X} \nu(E_x) d\mu(x) = \int_{Y} \mu(E^y)d\nu(y).
\]
  \begin{proof}
    TODO
  \end{proof}
\end{prop}</p><h3>Notation</h3><p>Let $(X, \SA, \mu)$
and $(Y, \SB, \nu)$
be sigma-finite
measurable spaces.
We denote the product
measure by $\mu \cross \nu$.
For all $A \in \SA$ and $B \in \SB$,
\[
  (\mu \cross \nu)(A \cross B) = \mu(A) \cross \nu(B).
\]</p>
