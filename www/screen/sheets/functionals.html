<h2>Why</h1><p>We speak of maps
from a vector space
to a field of scalars.</p><h2>Definition</h1><p>A
<b>functional</b>
is a function from
a set of vectors to a field.
It is natural, and common,
for the field of scalars
to be the base field.<p>A real-valued functional is
<b>non-negative</b>
if its
range is a subset of
the non-negative real
numbers.
A real-valued functional if
<b>definite</b>
if the only it maps to zero is
the zero element of the vector space.<p>A real-valued functional
on a real or complex
vector space is
<b>absolutely homogeneous</b>
if the result of a scaled vector
is the same as the result of the vector
scaled by the absolute value of the scalar.</p></div>
