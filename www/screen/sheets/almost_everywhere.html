<h2>Why</h1><p>We treat properties failing
on a set of measure zero
as
though they occur everyhwere;
especially in discussions of
convergence.</p><h2>Definition</h1><p>A subset of
the base set of a measure
space is
<b>negligible</b>
if there exists a
measurable set
with measure zero
containing
the subset.
Negligible sets
need not be
measurable.
<p>A property holds
<b>almost everywhere</b>
with respect to a measure
on a measure space if
the set of elements
of the base set on which
the property does not hold
is negligible.<p>If the property holds
everywhere, it holds
almost everywhere.
In this sense
we call the
almost everywhere sense
"weaker}{"
than the everywhere sense.</p><h3>Notation</h3><p>Let
$(X, \mathcal{A}, \mu)$
be a measure space.
A set
$N \subset X$ is
negligible if there
exists $A \in \mathcal{A}$
with $N \subset A$ and
$\mu(N) = 0$.<p>We abbreviate almost
everywhere as "a.e.,"
read "almost everywhere".
We say that a property
"holds a.e."
If the measure $\mu$ is
not clear from context,
we say that the property
holds almost everywhere
$[\mu]$ or
$\mu$-a.e., read
"mu almost everywhere."</p><h2>Examples</h1><p>Let $(X, \mathcal{A}, \mu)$
be a measure space
and let $R$ be the real numbers.</p><h3>Function Comparisons</h3><p>Let $f, g: X \to R$
be two functions on $X$,
not necessarily measurable.
Then $f = g$ almost everywhere
if the set of points at which the
functions disagree is
$\mu$-negligible.
Similarly, $f \geq g$ almost
everywhere if the set of points
where $f$ is less than $g$
is $\mu$-negligible.
If $f$ and $g$ are
$\mathcal{A}$-measurable, then
the sets
\[
\Set*{x \in X}{f(x) \neq g(x)}
\text{ and }
\Set*{x \in X}{f(x) < g(x)}
\]
are measurable; but they need
not be measurable otherwise.</p><h3>Function Limits</h3>
Let $\seqt{f}: X \to R$ for each natural
number $n$
and let
$f: X \to R$
be a function.
The sequence $\seq{f}$
<b>converges to $f$ almost everywhere</b>
if
\[
  \Set*{x \in X}{\lim_{n} \seqt{f} \text{ does not exist, or } f(x) \neq \lim_{n} \seqt{f}}
\]
is $\mu$-negligible.
In this case, we write
\say{
$f = \lim_n \seqt{f}$
almost everywhere.}</p></div>
