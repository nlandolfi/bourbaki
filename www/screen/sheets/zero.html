<h2>Why</h1><p>If I am holding
three pebbles, and I have three
in my left hand, how many
might I have in my right hand?
None, of course!<p>In the notation we have developed
we find solutions of
\[
  3 + n = 3,
\]
where $n$ is a natural number.
Unfortunately, any natural number
added to three is a number different
than three.
So there is no natural number
such that this equation holds.<p>How can we expand our algebra
so that we can express this
new, but common, situation in
our language?</p><h2>Definition</h1><p>We consider a superset
of the natural numbers with
one additional element.
We call this new elemenet
<b>zero</b>
and we call this new set
the
<b>natural numbers with zero</b>.</p><h3>Extending Arithmetic</h3><p>We extend the algebra on
the natural numbers to an
algebra on the natural numbers
with zero.<p>We define an extension of addition,
also called
<b>addition</b>.
Given two natural
numbers, we define the
result as the sum.
Given a natural number
and zero,
we define the result
to be the natural number,
and vice versa,
so that addition
still commutes.
As a function, addition
by zero is the identity.<p>We extend multiplication.
Given two natural
numbers, we define their
product as before.
Given a natural number
and zero,
we define the product
to be the zero,
and vice versa,
so that addition
still commutes.
As a function, mutliplication
by zero is constant.</p><h3>A new solution</h3><p>We have extended our algebra.
We can search for solutions of:
\[
  3 + n = 3
\]
where $n$ is a natural
number or zero.
Zero is a solution (by design)!
Since no natural number
solves, zero is
the only solution.</p><h3>Notation</h3><p>We denote zero by $0$.
For every natural number
$n$, we defined
\[
  n + 0 = 0 + n = n \quad \text{ and } \quad n \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot n = 0
\]</p></div>
