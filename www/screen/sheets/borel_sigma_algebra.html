<h2>Why</h1><p>We name and discuss
the topological
sigma algebra
on the real numbers;
the language and results
generalize to
finite direct
products of the real numbers.</p><h2>Definition</h1><p>The <b>Borel sigma algebra</b>
is the topological sigma algebra
for the real numbers with the usual topology;
we call its members the
<b>Borel sets</b>.</p><h2>Notation</h1><p>Throughout this sheet we denote
the real numbers by $R$.
As usual, then, we denote the $d$-dimensional
direct product of $R$ by $R^d$.
We denote the Borel sigma algebra
on $R^d$ by
$\mathcal{B}(R^d)$.
We denote $\mathcal{B}(R^1)$
by $\mathcal{B}(R)$.</p><h2>Alternate Generations</h1><p>The Borel sigma algebra
is useful because it contains
interesting sets
besides the open sets.
To make precise this statement, we show
that the Borel sigma algebra is generated
by, and therefore contains, other common
subsets of $R$.<p>\begin{prop}
If a sigma algebra $\mathcal{A}$
includes a particular set of subsets $\mathcal{B}$,
then $\mathcal{A}$ includes $\sigma(\mathcal{B})$.
\end{prop}<p>\begin{prop}
\label{borelalternategenerations}<p>Each of
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item
  the collection of all closed subsets of $R$,</p>  \item
  the collection of all subintervals of $R$ of the form $(-\infty, b]$,</p>  \item
  the collection of all subintervals of $R$ of the form $(a, b]$,
\end{enumerate}
generate $\mathcal{B}(R)$.<p>\begin{proof}<p>Denote the sigma algebra
which corresponds to (a) by
$\mathcal{B}_1$, that which corresponds
to (b) by $\mathcal{B}_2$, and that which
corresponds to (c) by $\mathcal{B}_3$.
It suffices to establish
$\mathcal{B}(R) \subset \mathcal{B}_3
\subset \mathcal{B}_2 \subset \mathcal{B}_1
\subset \mathcal{B}(R)$.<p>Start with $\mathcal{B}_1$.
Closed sets are the complement of open sets.
Thus $\mathcal{B}(R)$ contains all closed
sets and so contains the sigma algebra
generated by all closed sets, namely $\mathcal{B}_1$.<p>Next, $\mathcal{B}_2$.
The intervals $(-\infty, b])$ are closed.
Thus $\mathcal{B}_1$ contains all such intervals,
and so contains the sigma algebra generated by such
intervals, namely $\mathcal{B}_2$.<p>Next, $\mathcal{B}_3$.
An interval $(a, b]$ is
$(-\infty, b) \intersect C_R((-\infty, a])$.
Thus, all such intervals are contained in
$\mathcal{B}_2$, and so $\mathcal{B}_2$ contains
the sigma algebra generated by all such intervals,
namely, $\mathcal{B}_3$.<p>Each open interval of $R$ is the union
of a sequence of sets $(a, b]$; namely $(a, b-1/n]$.
So $\mathcal{B}_3$ contains all open intervals $(a, b)$.
Each open set of $R$ can be written as a countable
union of open intervals (proof: \boxed{TODO}).
Thus, $\mathcal{B}_3$ contains all open sets,
and therefore contains the sigma algebra
generated by the open subsets, namely $\mathcal{B}(R)$.
  \end{proof}
\end{prop}<p>\begin{prop}
  Each of:
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item
    the collection of all closed subsets of $R^d$,</p>  \item
  the collection of all closed half-spaces
  of $R^d$
  of the form
  $$\Set{(x_1, \dots, x_d)}{x_i \leq b_i}$$
  for some index $i$ and some $b$ in $R$,
  and</p>  \item
  the collection of all rectangles
  of $R^d$ of the form
  $$
      \Set{(x_1, \dots, x_d)}{a_i < x_i \leq b_i}
  $$
  \end{enumerate}</p>  generate $B(R^d)$.
\begin{proof}<p>Follow the proof of
Proposition~\ref{borelalternategenerations}.<p>The complement of open sets are closed.
Closed half spaces are closed.
A strip of the form
$\Set{(x_1, \dots, x_d)}{a_i < x_i \leq b_i}$
is the intersection of two
half-spaces in (b).
Each rectangle in (c) is the union of $d$
such strips.<p>\boxed{TODO}: two step last piece,
  open rectangles are unions of
  rectangles in (c) and
  open sets are union of open rectangles.<p>\end{proof}<p>\end{prop}</p>
