<h2>Why</h1><p>If I am holding
3 stones
in both hands,
and I have two of
them in my left hand,
how many might I have
in my right hand?
If I am holding
fewer than 5 pebbles, how
many might I have in my right hand?</p><h2>Overview</h1><p>An
<b>equation</b>
is an assertion that
two objects are the same.
An indeterminate
equation is one in
which some value
is unknown.
For example, I am
asserting above
that I have three
pebbles and that
I have two in my
left hand.
We know that the
total nu
A solution of
the equation
is any possible
number of pebbles
I could be holding
in my right hand
such that the sum
is three.<p>Discuss solutions
in a set.
Discuss existence
of solution.
Discuss uniqueness
of solution.</p><h3>Notation</h3><p>We can
denote the pebble
equation as
find $n$ so that
\[
  2 + n = 3
\]</p></div>
