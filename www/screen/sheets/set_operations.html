<h2>Why</h1><p>We want to consider the elements of two sets
together at once, and other sets created
from two sets.</p><h2>Definitions</h1><p>Let $A$ and $B$ be two \rt{sets}{set}.<p>The <b>union</b> of $A$ with $B$ is the
\rt{set}{set} whose \rt{elements}{element} are
in either $A$ <i>or} $B$ \textit{or</i> both.
The key word in the definition is <i>or</i>.<p>The <b>intersection</b> of $A$ with $B$ is
the set whose elements are in both $A$ <i>and</i> $B$.
The keyword in the definition is <i>and</i>.<p>Viewed as operations, both union and intersection commute;
this property justifies the language "with."
The intersection is a subset of $A$, of $B$,
and of the union of $A$ with $B$.<p>The <b>symmetric difference</b>
of $A$ and $B$ is the set whose elements are in the union
but not in the intersection.
The symmetric difference commutes because both union and
intersection commute; this property justifies the
language "and."
The symmetric difference is a subset of the union.
<p>Let $C$ be a set containing $A$.
The <b>complement</b> of $A$ in $C$ is
the symmetric difference of $A$ and $C$.
Since $A \subset C$, the union is $C$ and the
intersection is $A$.
So the complement is the "left-over" elements of $B$ after removing the elements of $A$.<p>We call these four operations
<b>set-algebraic operations</b>.</p><h3>Notation</h3><p>Let $A, B$ be sets.
We denote the union of $A$ with $B$ by $A \union B$, read aloud as "A union B."
$\union$ is a stylized U.
We denote the intersection of $A$ with $B$ by $A \intersect B$, read aloud as "A intersect B."
We denote the symmetric difference of $A$ and $B$ by $A \symdiff B$, read aloud as "A symdiff B."
"Delta" is a mnemonic for difference.<p>Let $C$ be a set containing $A$.
We denote the complement of $A$ in $C$ by $C - A$, read aloud as "C minus A."</p><h3>Results</h3><p>\begin{prop}
  For all sets $A$ and $B$ the operations $\union$, $\intersect$, and $\symdiff$ commute.
\end{prop}<p>\begin{prop}
  Let $S$ a set.
  For all sets $A, B \subset S$,
  \[
    \begin{aligned}
      \text{(1)} \quad & S - (A \union B) = (S - A) \intersect (S - B) \\
      \text{(2)} \quad & S - (A \intersect B) = (S - A) \union (S - B).
    \end{aligned}
  \]
\end{prop}<p>\begin{prop}
  Let $S$ a set. For all sets $A, B \subset S$,
  \[
    A \symdiff B = (A \union B) \intersect C_S(A \intersect B)
  \]
  \boxed{TODO: notation}
\end{prop}</p></div>
