<h2>Why</h1><p>We want to define the length
of a subset of real numbers.</p><h2>Notions</h1><p>We take two common notions:<p>\begin{enumerate}</p>  \item
  The length of a whole
  is the sum of the lengths
  of its parts;
  the <b>additivity principle</b>.</p>  \item
  The length of a whole
  is the at least the length
  of any whole it contains
  the <b>containment principle</b>.<p>\end{enumerate}<p>The task is to make precise
the use of
"whole,",
"parts,"
and "contains."
We start with intervals.</p><h2>Definition</h1><p>By whole we mean set.
By part we mean an element
of a partition.
By contains we mean set
containment.<p>The
<b>length</b>
of an interval is the difference
of its endpoints: the larger minus
the smaller.<p>Two intervals are
<b>non-overlapping</b>
if their intersection
is a single point or empty.
The <b>length</b> of the union of
two non-overlapping intervals is
the sum of their lengths.<p>A <b>simple</b> subset
of the real numbers
is a finite union
of non-overlapping intervals.
The length of a simple subset
is the sum of the lengths of
its family.<p>A <b>countably simple</b> subset
of the real numbers
is a countable union
of non-overlapping intervals.
The length of a countably simple subset
is the limit of the sum of the lengths
of its family; as we have defined it,
length is positive, so this series is either
bounded and increasing and so converges, or is
infinite, and so converges to $+\infty$.<p>At this point, we must confront the obvious
question: are all subsets of the real numbers
countably simple?
Answer: no.
So, what can we say?<p>A <b>cover</b>
of a set $A$ of real numbers
is a family whose union
is a contains $A$.
Since a cover always contains
the set $A$, it's length, which
we understand, must be larger
(containment principles) than
$A$.
So what if we declare that
the length of an arbitrary set
$A$ be the greatest lower bound
of the lengths of all sequences
of intervals covering $A$.
Will this work?</p><h3>Cuts</h3><p>If $a, b$ are real numbers and
$a < b$, then we <b>cut</b> an interval
with $a$ and $b$ as its endpoints
by selecting $c$ such that
$a < c$ and $c < b$.
We obtain two intervals, one with endpoints
$a,c$ and one with endpoints $c, b$;
we call these two the <b>cut pieces</b>.<p>Given an interval, the length of
the interval is the sum of any
two cut pieces, because the pieces
are non-overlapping.</p><h2>All sets</h1>

<p>\begin{prop}
  Not all subsets of
  real numbers are simple.</p>  Exhibit: R is not finite.
\end{prop}
<p>\begin{prop}
  Not all subsets of
  real numbers are countably simple.</p>  Exhibit: the rationals.
\end{prop}<p>Here's the great insight:
approximate a set
by a countable family of intervals.</p><h3>Notation</h3>
