<h2>Why</h1><p>We want to sum infinitely
many real numbers.</p><h2>Definition</h1>
<p>Let $n$ be a natural number.
The $n$th
<b>partial sum</b>
of a sequence of real numbers
is the sum of first $n$ elements
of the sequence.
The first partial sum is
the first term of the sequence.
The third partial sum
is the sum of first three
elements of the sequence.<p>The <b>series</b>
of the sequence is the
sequence of partial sums.
The sequence is
<b>summable</b>
if the series converges.<p>Since there exist
sequences which do not
converge, there
exist sequences which
are not summable.
Consider the sequence which
alternates between $+1$ and
$-1$, and starts with $+1$.
Its series alternates between
$+1$ and $0$, and so does
not converge.</p><h3>Notation</h3><p>Let $\seq{a}$ be a sequence
of real numnbers. For
natural number $n$, define:
\[
s_n = \sum_{k = 1}^{n} a_k.
\]
Then $\seq{s}$ is the series
of $\seq{a}$. If the series
converges, then there exists
a real number $s$, the limit,
and we write:
\[
  s = \lim_{n\to\infty} s_n = \lim_{n\to\infty} \sum_{k = 1}^{n} a_k
\]
We read these relations aloud as
\say{s is the limit as n goes to infinity
of s n} and
\say{s is the limit as n goes to infinity
of the sum of a k from k equals 1 to n.}<p>To avoid referencing $s_n$, we write:
\[
  \sum_{k = 1}^{\infty} a_k = s,
\]
read aloud as the
\say{the sum from 1 to infinity
of a k is s.}
The notation is subtle, and
requires justification
by the algebra of series. TODO</p></div>
