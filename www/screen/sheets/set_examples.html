<h2>Why</h1><p>We give some
examples
of objects
and sets.</p><h2>Examples</h1><p>For familiar examples,
let us start
with some tangible
objects.
Find, or call to
mind,
a deck
of playing cards.<p>First, consider
the set of all
the cards.
This set contains
fifty-two elements.
Second, consider
the set of cards
whose suit is hearts.
This set contains
thirteen elements:
the ace, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
jack, queen, and
king of hearts.
Third, consider
the set of twos.
This set contains
four elements:
the two of clubs,
the two of spades,
the two of hearts,
and the two of diamonds.<p>We can imagine many
more sets of cards.
If we are holding a deck,
each of these can be
made tangible: we can
touch the elements of
the set.
But the set itself
is always abstract:
we can not touch it.
It is the idea of the
group as distinct from
any individual member.<p>Moreover, the
elements of a set
need not be tangible.
First, consider the set
consisting of the suits of
the playing card:
hearts, diamonds, spades, and clubs.
This set has four elements.
Each element is a suit.<p>Second, consider the set
consisting of the card types.
This set has thirteen elements:
ace, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
jack, queen, king.
The subtlety here is that
this set is different than
the set of hearts, namely
those thirteen cards which are
hearts.
However these sets are
similar: they both have thirteen
elements, and there is a natural
correspondence between their
elements: the ace of hearts
with the type ace, the two
of hearts with the type two,
and so on.<p>Of course, sets need have nothing to
do with playing cards.
For example, consider the set of
seasons: autumn, winter, spring,
and summer.
This set has four elements.
For another example,
consider the set of Latin letters:
a, b, c, \dots, x, y, z.
This set has twenty-six elements.</p>
