<h2>Why</h1><p>We want to speak of the number of elements
of a set. Subtetly arises when we can not finish
counting the set's elements.</p><h2>Finite Definition</h1><p>If a set $A$ is contained in a set $B$ and not equal to $B$,
we say that $B$ is a <b>larger set</b> than $A$.
Conversely, we say that $A$ is a <b>smaller set</b> than $B$.
We reason that we could pair the elements of $B$ with themselves
in $A$ and still have some elements of $B$ left over.<p>A <b>finite set</b> is one whose elements we can count
and the process terminates.
For example, $\set{1, 2, 3}$ or $\set{a,b,c,d}$.
The <b>cardinality</b> of a finite set is the number of
elements it contains.
The cardinality of $\set{1, 2, 3}$ is 3 and the cardinality of
$\set{a,b,c,d}$ is 4.</p><h3>Notation</h3><p>Let $A$ be a non-empty set.
We denote the cardinality of $A$ by $\card{A}$.</p><h2>Infinite Definition</h1><p>Suppose we know that the counting process could never terminate.
This situation superficially seems bizarre, but is in fact built
in to some of our fundamental notions: namely, the natural numbers.
We defined the natural numbers in a manner which made them not
finite.<p>If we had a bag of natural numbers, we could use the total order
to find the largest, and then use the existence of a successor to
add a new largest number.
Therefore, bizarrely, the process of counting the natural numbers
can not terminate.<p>An <b>infinite set</b> is a non-empty set which is not finite.
So the natural numbers are an infinite set.
Alternatively we say that there are <b>infinitely many</b>
natural numbers.
The negating prefix "in" emphasizes that we have defined
the nature of the size of the naturals indirectly: their size
is not something we understand from the simple intuition of
counting, but in contrast to the simple intuition of counting.<p>Still, we imagine that if we could go on forever, we could count
the natural numbers; so in an infinite sense, they are countable.
A <b>countable</b> set is one which is either (a) finite or
(b) one for which there exists a one-to-one function mapping
the natural numbers onto the set.<p>The natural numbers are countable: we exhibit the identity function.
Less obviously the integer numbers and rational numbers are countable.
Even more bizarre, the real numbers are not countable.
An <b>uncountable</b> set is one which is not countable.</p><h3>Notation</h3><p>We denote the cardinality of the natural numbers by $\aleph_0$.</p></div>
