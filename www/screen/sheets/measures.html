<h2>Why</h1><p>We want to generalize the notion
of length, area, volume beyond the
Lebesgue measure on the product spaces
of real numbers.</p><h2>Definition</h1><p>An extended-real-valued non-negative
function on an algebra is
<b>finitely additive</b>
if the result of the function applied to
the union of a disjoint finite family of
distinguished sets is the sum of the
results of the function applied to each
of the sets individually.<p>An extended-real-valued non-negative
function on a sigma algebra is
<b>countably additive</b>
if the result of the function applied to
the union of a disjoint countable family of
distinguished sets is the limit of the partial
sums of the results of the function applied
to each of the sets individually.<p>A
<b>finitely additive measure</b>
is an extended-real-valued non-negative
finitely additive function which associates the empty
set with the real number $0$.
A
<b>countably additive measure</b>
is an extended-real-valued non-negative
countably additive function which associates the empty
set with the real number $0$.
We call countably additive measures
<b>measures</b>, for short.<p>Every countably additive measure is finitely additive.
On the other hand, there exist finitely additive measures
which are not countable additive.<p>In the context of measure,
we call a countably unitable subset algebra
a <b>measurable space</b>.
We call the distinguished sets
<b>measurable</b>
sets.
A
<b>measure space</b>
is triple.
As a pair, the first two
objects are a measurable space.
The third object is a measure defined
on the sigma algebra of teh measurable space.</p><h2>Notation</h1><p>Let $A$ a set.
Let $\mathcal{A}$ a sigma algebra on $A$.
The pair $(A, \mathcal{A})$ is a measurable space.<p>Let $\mu: \mathcal{A} \to [0, \infty]$ a measure;
thus:
(a) $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$ and
(b) for disjoint $\set{A_n} \subset \mathcal{A}$,
$\mu(\cup_{n = 1}^{\infty} A_n)
  = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \mu(A_n)$
The triple $(A, \mathcal{A}, \mu)$ is a
measure space.<p>We use $\mu$ since it
is a mnemonic for "measure".
We often also us
$\nu$ to denote measures,
since it is after
$\mu$ in the Greek alphabet,
and $\lambda$, since
it is before
$\mu$ in the Greek alphabet.</p><h2>Examples</h1><p>\begin{expl}
Let $(A, \mathcal{A})$ a measurable space.
Let $\mu: \mathcal{A} \to [0, +\infty]$ such that
$\mu(A)$ is $\card{A}$ if $A$ is finite
and $\mu(A)$ is $+\infty$ otherwise.
Then $\mu$ is a measure.
We call $\mu$ the
<b>counting measure</b>.
\end{expl}<p>\begin{expl}
Let $(A, \mathcal{A})$ measurable.
Fix $a \in A$.
Let $\mu: \mathcal{A} \to [0, +\infty]$ such
that $\mu(A)$ is $1$ if $a \in A$ and
$\mu(A)$ is $0$ otherwise.
Then $\mu$ is a measure.
We call $\mu$ the
<b>point mass</b>
concentrated at $a$.
\end{expl}<p>\begin{expl}
Let $R$ denote the real numbers.
The Lebesgue measure on the measurable
space $(R, \mathcal{B}(R))$ is a measure.
\end{expl}<p>\begin{expl}
Let $N$ be the natural numbers.
Let $\mathcal{A}$ the finite
co-finite algebra on $N$.
Let $\mu: \mathcal{A} \to [0, +\infty]$
be such that $\mu(A)$ is 1 if
$A$ is infinite or 0 otherwise.
Then $\mu$ is a finitely additive measure.
However it is impossible to extend
$\mu$ to be a countably additive measure.
Observe that if $A_n = \set{n}$ the
$\mu(\union_{n} A_n) = 1$ but
$\sum_{n} \mu(A_n) = 0$.
\end{expl}<p>\begin{expl}
Let $(A, \mathcal{A})$ a measurable
space.
Let $\mu: \mathcal{A} \to [0, +\infty]$
be $0$ if $A = \emptyset$ and
$\mu(A)$ is $+\infty$ otherwise.
Then $\mu$ is a measure.
\end{expl}<p>\begin{expl}
Let $A$ be set with at least
two elements ($\card{A} \geq 2$).
Let $\mathcal{A} = \powerset{A}$.
Let $\mu: \mathcal{A} \to [0, +\infty]$
such that $\mu(A)$ is $0$ if $A = \emptyset$
and $\mu(A) = 1$ otherwise.
Then $\mu$ is not a measure,
nor is $\mu$ finitely additive.
\begin{proof}
Let $B, C \in \mathcal{A}$,
$B \intersect C = \emptyset$
then using finite additivity
we obtain a contradiction
$
1 = \mu(B \union C) = \mu(B) + \mu(C) = 2
$.
\end{proof}
\end{expl}</p>
