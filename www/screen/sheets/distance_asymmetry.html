<h2>Why</h1><p>Sometimes "distance"
as used in the English language
refers to an asymmetric  concept.
This apparent paradox further
illuminates the symmetry property.</p><h2>Apparent Paradox</h1><p>Distance in the plane is
symmetric: the distance from
one point to another does
not depend on the order of the
points so considered.
We took this observation as
a definiting property
of our abstract notion
of distance.
The meaning, strength, and
limitation of
this property
is clarified by considering an
asymmetric case.<p>Contrast walking up a hill
with walking down it.
The "distance" between these
two points, the top of the hill
and a point on its base,
may not be symmetric with respect to
the time taken or the effort involved.
Experience might suggest
that it will take longer
to walk up the hill
than to walk down it.
A superficial justification may
include reference to the some
notion of uphill walking requiring
more effort.<p>If we were going to model the top and
base of the hill
as points in space, however, the
distance between them is the same: it
is symmetric.
It is even the same if we take into
account that some specific path, a trail
say, must be followed.<p>If planning a backpacking trip,
such symmetry appears foolish.
The distance between two
locations must not be considered
symmetric.
Going up the mountain takes longer
than going down.
It may justify, in the English
phrase, \say{going around,
rather than going over.}</p>
