<h2>Why</h1><p>We want to talk about a set
with a prescribed quantitative
degree of closeness (or distance)
between its elements.</p><h2>Definition</h1><p>The correspondences
which serve as a
degree of closeness,
or measure of distance, must
satisify our notions of distances
previously developed.<p>A function on ordered pairs which
does not depend on the order of
the elements so considered is
<b>symmetric</b>.
A function into the real numbers
which takes only non-negative
values is <b>non-negative</b>.
A repeated pair is an ordered pair
of the same element twice.
A function which satisfies
a triangle inequality for any
three elements is
<b>triangularly transitive</b>.<p>A <b>metric</b>
(or <b>distance function</b>)
is a function
on ordered pairs of elements
of a set which
is symmetric, non-negative,
zero only on repeated pairs,
and triangularly
transitive.
A <b>metric space</b>
is an ordered
pair: a set with
a metric on the set.<p>In a metric space,
we say that one pair
of objects is <b>closer</b>
together if
the metric
of the first pair
is smaller than the
metric value of the
second pair.</p><h3>Notation</h3><p>Let $A$ be a set
and let $R$ be the set
of real numbers.
We commonly denote
a metric by the letter
$d$, as a mnemonic
for "distance."
Let $d: A \times A \to R$.
Then $d$ is a metric if:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    it is non-negative,
    which we tend to denote by
    $$
      d(a, b) \geq 0, \quad \forall a,b \in A.
    $$
              \item
    it is $0$ only on repeated pairs, which we tend to denote
    by
    $$
      d(a, b) = 0 \Leftrightarrow a = b, \quad \forall a,b \in A.
    $$</p>  \item
    it is symmetric, which we tend to denote by:
    $$
      d(a, b) = d(b, a), \quad \forall a,b \in A.
    $$
  \item
    it is triangularly transitive, which we tend to
    denote by
    $$
      d(a, b) \leq d(a, c) + d(c, b), \quad \forall a,b,c \in A.
    $$
\end{enumerate}
As usual, we denote the metric space
of $A$ with $d$ by
$(A, d)$.</p>
