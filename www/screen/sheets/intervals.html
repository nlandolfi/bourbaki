<h2>Why</h1><p>We name and denote
subsets of the
set of real numbers
which correspond to segments
of a line.</p><h2>Definition</h1><p>Take two real numbers, with the
first less than the second.<p>An
<b>interval</b>
is one of four sets:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  the set of real numbers larger
  than the first number and smaller
  than the second; we call the
  interval <b>open</b>.</p>  \item
  the set of real numbers larger than
  or equal to the first number and
  smaller than or equal to the second
  number; we call the interval
  <b>closed</b>.</p>  \item
  the set of real numbers larger
  than the first number and smaller
  than or equal to the second;
  we call the interval
  <b>open on the left</b>
  and
  <b>closed on the right</b>.</p>  \item
  the set of real numbers larger
  than or equal to the first number
  and smaller than the second;
  we call the interval
  <b>closed on the left</b>
  and
  <b>open on the right</b>.
\end{enumerate}
If an interval is neither open
nor closed we call it
<b>half-open</b>
or
<b>half-closed</b><p>We call the two numbers
the
<b>endpoints</b>
of the interval.
An open interval does not
contain its endpoints.
A closed interval contains
its endpoints.
A half-open/half-closed
interval contains only one
of its endpoints.
We say that the
endpoints
<b>delimit</b>
the interval.</p><h3>Notation</h3><p>Let $a, b$ be two real numbers
which satisfy the relation $a < b$.<p>We denote the open interval from
$a$ to $b$ by $(a, b)$.
This notation, although standard,
is the same as that for ordered pairs;
no confusion arises with adequate context.<p>We denote the closed interval from
$a$ to $b$ by $[a, b]$.
We record the fact
$(a, b) \subset [a, b]$
in our new notation.<p>We denote the half-open interval
from $a$ to $b$,
closed on the right, by $(a, b]$
and the half-open interval
from $a$ to $b$,
closed on the left, by $[a, b)$.</p></div>
