<h2>Why</h1>
<p>We want to define area
under a real function.
We begin with functions
whose area under the curve
is self-evident.</p><h2>Definition</h1><p>Consider a measure space.
The characteristic function
of any measurable set
is measurable.
A simple function is measurable
if and only if
each element of
its simple partition
is measurable.
<p>The
<b>integral</b>
of a measurable non-negative simple function
is the sum of the products
of the measure of each piece
with the value of the function on that piece.
For example, the integral
of a measurable characteristic function
of a subset is the
measure of that subset.<p>The
<b>integral operator</b>
is the real-valued function
which associates
each measurable non-negative simple
function with its integral.
The simple integral is non-negative,
so the integral operator is
a non-negative function.</p><h3>Notation</h3><p>Let $(X, \mathcal{A}, \mu)$
be a measure space.
Let
$R$ be the
set of real numbers.
<p>Let $f: X \to R$ be
a measurable simple function.
So there exist
$A_1, \dots, A_n \in \mathcal{A}$
and $a_1, \dots, a_n \in R$ with:
\[
  f = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} a_i \chi_{A_i}.
\]<p>We denote the integral of
$f$
with respect to measure $\mu$
by $\int f d\mu$.
We defined:
\[
  \int f d\mu = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} a_i \mu(A_i).
