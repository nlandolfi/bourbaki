<h2>Why</h1><p>Sometimes we want finite measures.</p><h2>Definition</h1><p>A measurable set is
<b>finite</b>
if its measure is a real number.
The measure space itself is
<b>finite</b>
if the base set is finite.<p>A measurable set is
<b>sigma-finite</b>
if there exists a sequence of
finite measurable sets whose
union is the set.
The measure space itself is
<b>sigma-finite</b>
if the base set is sigma finite.</p><h3>Notation</h3><p>We denote that a measure
space is finite by saying
"Let $(A, \mathcal{A", \mu)$
and $\mu(A) < +\infty$.}<p>\begin{expl}
Let $(A, \mathcal{A})$ be a measurable space.<p>The counting measure on $(A, \mathcal{A})$ is
finite if and only if the base set is finite.
It is sigma finite if and only if the base
set is a union of a sequence of finite sets.<p>If $\mathcal{A} = 2^A$, then the counting
measure is sigma finite if and only if
$A$ is countable.
\end{expl}<p>\begin{expl}
A point mass measure is finite.
\end{expl}<p>\begin{expl}
Let $R$ be the set of real numbers.
The Lebesgue measure on
$(R, \mathcal{B}(R))$ is sigma finite.
