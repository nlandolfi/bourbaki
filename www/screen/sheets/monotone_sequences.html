<h2>Why</h1><p>If the base set of a
sequence has a partial
order, then we can
discuss its relation
to the order
of sequence.</p><h2>Definition</h1><p>A sequence on a partially
ordered set is
<b>non-decreasing</b>
if whenever
a first index precedes
a second index the element
associated with the
first index precedes
the element associated with
the second element.
A sequence on a partially
ordered set is
<b>increasing</b>
if it is non-decreasing and
no two elements are the same.<p>A sequence on a partially
ordered set is
<b>non-increasing</b>
if whenever
a first index precedes
a second index the element
associated with the
first index succedes
the element associated with
the second element.
A sequence on a partially
ordered set is
<b>decreasing</b>
if it is non-increasing and
no two elements are the same.<p>A sequence on a partially
ordered set is
<b>monotone</b>
if it is non-decreasing,
or non-increasing.
An increasing sequence is
non-decreasing.
A decreasing sequences is
non-increasing.
A sequence on a partially
ordered set is
<b>strictly monotone</b>
if it is decreasing,
or increasing.</p><h3>Notation</h3>
<p>Let $A$ a non-empty set with
partial order $\preceq$.
Let $\seq{a}$ a sequence in $A$.<p>The sequence is
non-decreasing if
$n \leq m \implies a_n \preceq a_m$,
and increasing if
$n < m \implies a_n \prec a_m$.
The sequence is
non-increasing if
$n \leq m \implies a_n \succeq a_m$,
and decreasing if
$n < m \implies a_n > a_m$.</p><h2>Examples</h1><p>\begin{expl}
  Let $A$ a non-empty set
  and $\seq{A}$ a sequence of
  sets in $\powerset{A}$.
  Partially order elements
  of $\powerset{A}$ by
  the relation contained in.
