<h2>Why</h1><p>We want to visualize relations.</p><h2>Definition</h1><p>A <b>graph</b> is a set and a relation
on the set.
The graph is <b>undirected</b>
if the relation is symmetric; otherwise the
graph is <b>directed</b>.<p>A <b>vertex</b> of the graph is an element
of the set.
The set is called the <b>vertex set</b>.
An <b>edge</b> of the graph is an element of
the relation.
The relation is called the <b>edge set</b>.</p>
<h3>Notation</h3><p>We denote the vertex set by $V$, a mnemonic for
vertex.
We denote the edge set by $E$, a mnemonic for
edge.
We denote a graph by $(V, E)$.
If the vertex set is assumed we can
unambiguously refer to the graph by $E$.</p><h3>Visualization</h3><p>We visualize a graph by drawing a
point for each vertex.
If two vertices $u$ and $v$ are in relation,
we draw a line from the point corresponding
to $u$ to the point corresponding to $v$ with
an arrow at the point corresponding to $v$.
If the graph is undirected, we omit arrows.
Here are all undirected graphs on three
vertices.</p>
<h2>Paths</h1><p>A path in a graph is a sequence of
vertices with the property that
consecutive vertices are related.
A path <b>cycles</b> if a vertex
appears more than once.
A path is <b>finite</b> if the
sequence is finite.
A <b>loop</b> is a finite path
that cycles once.
A finite path from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$
is a path starting with $u$ and
ending with $v$.
The <b>length</b> of a finite path is
the length of the sequence.</p><h2>Properties</h1><p>A graph is <b>connected</b>
if there is a path between every pair
of vertices. A graph is
<b>acyclic</b> if none of its
paths cycle.</p>
