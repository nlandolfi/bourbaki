<h2>Why</h1><p>For the difference of
two (signed) measures to
be well-defined, we need one
of the two to be finite.
Otherwise,
the measure of the difference
on the base set involves subtracting
$\infty$ from $\infty$.</p><h2>Definition</h1><p>A
<b>finite</b>
signed measure is one for
which the measure of every set
is finite.
This condition is equivalent
to the base set having finite
measure (see below).</p><h2>Result</h1><p>\begin{prop}
\label{prop:finitesignedmeasures}
A signed measure is finite
if and only if it is finite
on the base set.<p>\begin{proof}
Let $(X,\SA)$ be a measurable space.
Let $\mu: \SA \to \eri$ be a signed measure.
($\Rightarrow$) If $\mu$ is finite, then $\mu(X)$
is finite since $X \in \mathcal{A}$.
($\Leftarrow)$
Next, suppose $\mu(X)$ is finite.
Let $A \in \SA$.
Then $X = A \union (X - A)$,
with these sets disjoint,
so by countable additivity
of $\mu$,
$\mu(X) = \mu(A) + \mu(X - A)$.
Since $\mu(X)$ finite, $\mu(A)$
and $\mu(X - A)$ are both finite.
\end{proof}
\end{prop}</p></div>
