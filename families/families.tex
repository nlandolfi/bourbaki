\section{Why}

\boxed{TODO}


\section{Definition}

We often refer to a collection of subsets of some set via some index which is an element of another set.
We call the indexing set the \definition{index set} and set of indexed sets an \definition{indexed family}.
We define the set whose elements are the objects which are contained in at least one family member the \definition{family union}.
We define the set whose elements are the obejcts which are contained in all of the family members the \definition{family intersection}.

\subsection{Notation}

Let $S$ be a set.
We often denote the index set by $I$, though this is not required.
For each $\alpha \in I$, let $A_{\alpha} \subset S$.
We denote the family of $A_{\alpha}$ indexed with $I$ by $\set{A_{\alpha}}_{\alpha \in I}$.
We read this notation \say{A sub-alpha, alpha in I.}

We denote the family union by $\union_{\alpha \in I} A_{\alpha}$.
We read this notation as \say{union over alpha in I of A sub-alpha.}
We denote family intersection by $\intersect_{\alpha \in I} A_{\alpha}$.
We read this notation as \say{intersection over alpha in I of A sub-alpha.}

\subsection{Results}

\begin{prop}
  For an indexed family $\set{A_{\alpha}}_{\alpha \in I}$ in $S$, if $I = \set{i, j}$ then
  \[
    \union_{\alpha \in I} A_{\alpha} = A_i \union A_j
  \]
  and
  \[
    \intersect_{\alpha \in I} A_{\alpha} = A_i \intersect A_j.
  \]
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}
  For an indexed family $\set{A_{\alpha}}_{\alpha \in I}$ in $S$, if $I = \emptyset$, then
  \[
    \union_{\alpha \in I} A_{\alpha} = \emptyset
  \]
  and
  \[
    \intersect_{\alpha \in I} A_{\alpha} = S.
  \]
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}
  For an indexed family $\set{A_{\alpha}}_{\alpha \in I}$ in $S$.
  \[
    C_S(\union_{\alpha \in I} A_{\alpha}) = \intersect_{\alpha \in I} C_S(A_{\alpha})
  \]
  and
  \[
    C_S(\intersect_{\alpha \in I} A_{\alpha}) = \union_{\alpha \in I} C_S(A_{\alpha}).
  \]
\end{prop}
