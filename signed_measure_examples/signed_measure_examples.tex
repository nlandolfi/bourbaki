\stitle{Signed Measure Examples}

\ssection{Why}

Let us consider
examples of signed measures.
TODO

\ssection{Examples}

Consider an integrable
function defined on
some measurable space.
The extended-real-valued
funciton which assigns to
each distinguished set the
value of the integrating
the function over that set
is a signed measure.

\begin{expl}
  Let $(X, \SA, \mu)$
  a measure space.
\end{expl}
