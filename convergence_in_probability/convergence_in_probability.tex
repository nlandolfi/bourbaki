\ssection{Definition}

A sequence of
random variables
convergences in probability
if it converges in measure.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(X, \SA, \mu)$ be
a measure space.
Let $\seq{f}$ a sequence
of real-valued measurable
functions on $X$. Let
$f: X \to R$ be measurable
function.
If $f_n$ converges in measure
to $f$ we write:
$f_n \goesto f$ in probability,
read aloud as
\say{f n goes to f in probability.}

Suppose $f_n \goesto f$ in probability.
Then for every $\epsilon > 0$,
\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \mu(\Set*{x \in X}{\abs{f_n(x) - f(x)} > \epsilon}) = 0.
\]
