\ssection{Definition}

The \ct{expectation}{expectation}
of a real-valued random variable
defined on a probability space
is its integral
with respect to
the probability measure.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(X, \SA, \mu)$
be a probability space
and $f$ be a random variable.
We denote the expectation
of $f$ by $\Expect f$.
We defined it by
\[
  \Expect f = \int f d\mu.
\]
