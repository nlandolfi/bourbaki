\section{Why}

We want a notion of combining elements of a set to get another (possibly different) element of the set.

\section{Basics}


Let $A$ a set.
An \definition{operation} on $A$ is a function $g: A \times A \to A$.
Operations map ordered pairs of elements of a set to elements of the same set.
An \definition{algebra} is a set together with an operation.


\subsection{Notation}

Let $A$ a set and $g: A \times A \to A$.
We commonly forego the notation $g(a, b)$ and instead write $a\,g\,b$.
We call this style \definition{infix} notation.
Using lower case latin letters for every object is confusing, but we often have special symbols for particular operations.
Examples of such symbols include $+$, $-$, $\cdot$, $\circ$, and $\star$.
