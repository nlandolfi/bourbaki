\ssection{Definition}

Two random
variables are
\ct{independent and
  identically distributed}{}
  if they are independent
  and have the same law.
A sequence of random variables
is \ct{independent and
  identically distributed}{}
  if the random variables are
  independent
  and each random variable
  has the same law.

\ssubsection{Notation}

We abbreviate
independent and
identically distributed
by \ct{i.i.d.}{iid},
read aloud as
\say{i i d}.
