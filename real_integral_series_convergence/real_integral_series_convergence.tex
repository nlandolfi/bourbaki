\stitle{Real Integral Series Convergence}

\ssection{Why}

Sums of non-negative
functions are increasing,
and workable with the
monotone convergence theorem.

\ssection{Result}


\begin{prop}

The integral of
the limit of the
partial sums of a sequence
of measurable,
nonnegative,
extended-real-valued
functions is the
limit of the partial sums of the
integrals.

\begin{proof}
Let $(X, \mathcal{A}, \mu)$
be a measure space,
and let $\seqt{f}: \to \nneri$
a $\mathcal{A}$-measurable function
for every natural number $n$.
We want to show that:
\[
  \int \sum_{k = 1}^{\infty} f_k d\mu =
  \sum_{k = 1}^{\infty} \int f_k d\mu.
\]
We apply the monotone convergence theorem
to the sequence $\set{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}f_i}_n$.
This sequence is nondecreasing because
$f_n \geq 0$ for all $n$.
\end{proof}
\end{prop}
