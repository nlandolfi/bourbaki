\textbf{Editor's Preface}
\end{center}

This project is one of the more ambitious with which I am affiliated.
Its two-fold goal is to explain mathematics to the novice and provide standardized language for the expert.
The reader should note that I have cut this edition under the pressure of time, in accordance with my annual goals for the project, and not because I felt we had reached a reasonable landmark, or that the content was particularly polished.

So then, what is here?
An attempt to talk about language, symbols, intangible objects and logical reasoning enough to get to a few principles having to do with intangible objects called sets and a few things you can build out of these sets.
The construction of real numbers and their relation to the lines of geometry becomes quite sparse toward the end, but the outline is included.
The $n$-dimensional real space is touched upon, and barely metric spaces, barely topological spaces.

On that last point, I should mention that the original goal for this edition was to reach topological spaces.
We agreed that this topic involved sufficiently abstract concepts which could test the project's assumptions.
We all agree, now, that there was much more to be said (to the novice) about topics much preliminary to topological spaces.
More than we anticipated.
We could, early on, define a topological space in terms of sets.
But we could not say why we cared.
And this idea, that we might say why we wanted a new concept before we introduced it, was an assumption we were testing with this project.

What were the other assumptions to be tested?
%What are these assumptions?
First, that the concepts and discussion could be so ordered that we only use prior concepts and discussion.
Second, that we could structure the book so that topics are treated by short, two-page sheets.
%Third, that a development could be given which justified the introduction of each new concept as we go, even if on superficial grounds (this is why each section has a \say{Why}).
Third, that such a treatment would be useful as a reference.
Fourth, that we could standardize language (perhaps formally) and use it in all theorems, definitions and proofs.

These traits would undoubtedly be useful.
The sheets could serve both as a beginner's guide and a reference.
When reaching for a particular topic, the prerequisites would be clear, fine-grained, and each one only two-pages long.
And a standardized language to facilitate understanding and communication is a centuries-old endeavor.
That no such text exists, to our knowledge, must indicate that its construction is accompanied by great difficulty.
But that is not to say impossible, and computers and screens may facilitate the process.

% The name of our project is a reference to a similarly themed endeavor of the last century.
% We have not space to outline our differences, but our readers will find us doing much more work to justify not only why a particular concept or theory is being defined, but even why anything is being said at all.
%The differences between our approach and theirs will be obvious to the reader.
%I have not space here to outline the differences between our approach and theirs, but the hypotheses of the previous paragraph are very nearly guiding principles for this project.
%As one example, Bourbaki began abstract, and then specialized.
%The treatment is meant to be \say{genetic,} in the words of Otto Toeplitz.
%In \textit{Calculus: A Genetic Approach}, Toeplitz explores the infinite process (taking limits, derivatives, integrals) by reviewing the sorts of things one wants to do (approximate quantities, model trajectory motion, compute areas) and then developing the mathematics.
% How then do we view this edition?
% I am known to many by an upbeat demeanor.
% True to my blood I will here include the formal statement that we have (if only just slightly) achieved our goal.
% Future editions will be the test.
% I would say we have just slightly achieved this goal, but the treatment is weak.
% This then is the influence of one of the assumptions of the project.

The text you hold is the first edition.
And we might call it a first attempt.
It is incomplete and with flaws.
But that is not to say useless.
There is visible in it the form of what is to come, if only you look at it properly.
And, in any case, it is time that we have a first edition.
