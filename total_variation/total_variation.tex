\stitle{Total Variation}

\ssection{Why}

We want a norm
on the space of
measures.

\ssection{Definition}

The
\ct{total variation}{totalvariation}
of finite measure is the variation
measure of the base set.
We show below that the total
variation is a norm on the
vector space of finite measures.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $R$ denote the
set of real numbers.
Let $(X, \SA)$
be a measurable sapce
and $\mu: X \to R$
be a finite signed measure.
We denote the total
variation by
$\tvnorm{\mu}$.

Let $\vmeas{\mu}$
be the variation of
$\mu$.
Then,
$\tvnorm{\mu} = \vmeas{\mu}(X)$.
