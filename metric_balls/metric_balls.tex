\stitle{Metric Balls}

\ssection{Why}

We want to talk about
the set of points which
are all within some distance
of a fixed point.

\ssection{Definition}

Consider a metric space
and an element of the base
set.
The \ct{metric ball}{} of
radius $r$ centered
at the element is the set
of all elements which are
less than $r$-distance from
the elemnt.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(A, d)$ be a metric space.
Let $a \in A$.
Let $r$ be a real number.
Then the ball centered
at $a$ of radius $r$ is
\[
  \Set*{b \in A}{d(a, b) < r}.
\]
We denote the ball
centered at $a$ of radius
$r$ by $B(a, r)$.
