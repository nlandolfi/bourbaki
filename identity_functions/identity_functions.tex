\stitle{Identity Functions}

\ssection{Why}

What is a simple
function?

\ssection{Definition}

Consider the relation on
a non-empy set which includes
ordered pairs of elements
from the set if the first
element is the second element.
In other words, two elements
are related if and only if
they are the same object.

This relation is functional:
Each element corresponds to
only one element: itself.
We call this functional relation
the
\ct{identity function}{}
of the set.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $A$ be a non-empty set.
If $f: A \to A$ satisfies
$f(a) = a$ for each $a \in A$,
  then $f$ is the identity function.

We denote the identity
function on $A$ by $\id_A$.
