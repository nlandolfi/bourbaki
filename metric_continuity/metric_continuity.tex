\stitle{Metric Continuity}

\ssection{Why}

We define continuity for
functions between metric
spaces.


\ssection{Definition}

Take two metric spaces.
A function from the
first metric space to the
second metric space is
\ct{continuous at an object}{continuousat}
if, for every ball of positive
radius around the result of the object,
there exists a ball
of positive radius
around the element
whose image is contained
in the first ball.

A function betwee metric
spaces is continuous if it is
\ct{continuous}{metriccontintuousfunction}
at each point of the domain.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(A, d)$ and $(B, d')$
be metric spaces.
Let $f: A \to B$.
Then $f$ is continuous at $a \in A$,
if for all $\epsilon > 0$,
there exists $\delta > 0$
such that
\[
  f(B(a, \delta)) \subset B(f(a), \epsilon).
\]
