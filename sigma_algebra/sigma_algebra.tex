\stitle{Sigma Algebra}

\ssection{Why}

We aim toward defining
a notion of length on the
real line, a function from
subsets of the real numbers
to a non-negative real number
or infinity.
A function with natural properties
of length can not be defined
for all subsets of the real numbers,
but can on
Such a function does not exist

We fail for all sets,
but we succeed on a
subset space whose distinguished
sets are a sigma algebra.

\ssection{Definition}

A \ct{sigma algebra}{sigmaalgebra}
a subset algebra which is closed
under countable unions.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $A$ be a set and $\mathcal{A} \subset \powerset{A}$.
We denote the subset algebra of $A$ and $\mathcal{A}$
by $\tuple{A, \mathcal{A}}$, read aloud as \say{A, script
  A.}

\ssection{Properties}

\begin{prop}
  For any set $A$, $2^{A}$ is a sigma algebra.
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}
  The intersection of a family of sigma algebras is
  a sigma algebra.
  \label{sigma_algebra:sigmaintersection}
\end{prop}

\ssection{Generation}

\begin{prop}
  Let $A$ a set and $\mathcal{B}$ a set of subsets.
  There is a unique smallest sigma algebra
  $(A, \mathcal{A})$ with
  $\mathcal{B} \subset \mathcal{A}$.
\end{prop}

We call the unique smallest sigma algebra
containing $B$ the
\ct{generated sigma algebra}{}
of $B$.
