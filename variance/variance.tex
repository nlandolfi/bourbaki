\ssection{Why}

\ssection{Definition}

The \ct{variance}{variance}
of a square-integrable
real-valued random variable
is the expectation of its
square less its expectation
squared.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(X, \SA, \mu)$
be a probability space
and $f$ be a random variable.
We denote the variance
of $f$ by $\var f$.
We defined it by
\[
  \var f = \Expect(f^2) - (\Expect(f))^2.
\]

\ssection{Result}

\begin{prop}
The variance of a
square-integrable
real-valued random
variable is
the expectation
of the square of
the difference between
the random variable
and its expectation.
\begin{proof}
\[
  \var f = \Expect((f - \Expect(f))^2)
\]
\end{proof}
\end{prop}
