\ssection{Definition}

A \t{generative probabilistic model} (or \t{generative model}) is a probabilistic model.
The term \say{generative} arises from a distinctive feature of these models that we can sample from them using digital computers.\footnote{Future editions will discuss digital computers, and may collapse this sheet with probabilistic models sheet on which it depends.}
