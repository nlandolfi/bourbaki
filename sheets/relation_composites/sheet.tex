\section*{Why}

If $x$ is related to $y$ and $y$ to $z$, then $x$ and $z$ are related.

\section*{Definition}

Let $R$ be a relation from $X$ to $Y$ and $S$ a relation from $Y$ to $Z$.
The \t{composite relation} from $X$ to $Z$ contains the pair $(x, z) \in (X \times  Z)$ if and only if there exists a $y \in Y$ such that $(x, y) \in R$ and $(y,z) \in S$.
This composite relation is sometimes called the \t{relative product}.

\section*{Notation}

We denote the composite relation of $R$ and $S$ by $R \circ S$ or $RS$.

\section*{Example}

Let $X$ be the set of people and let $R$ be the relation in $X$ ``is a brother of'' and $S$ be the relation in $X$ ``is a father of''.
Then $RS$ is the relation ``is an uncle of''.

\section*{Properties}

Composition of relation is associative but not commutative.\footnote{A fuller account will appear in future editions.}
