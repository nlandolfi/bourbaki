§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $G$ is a␣
    <a href='/sheets/groups.html'>
      ‖ finite group ⦉
    </a>
    ␣with identity 1 and suppose $V$ is a vector space over
    the field $𝗖$ of complex numbers. ⦉

  ‖ A ❬linear representation❭ $ρ: G → GL(V)$ of $G$ in $V$ is
    a␣
    <a href='/sheets/homomorphisms.html'>
      ‖ group homomorphism ⦉
    </a>
    ␣from $G$ to the general linear group $GL(V)$. ⦉

  ‖ Given $ρ$, we call $V$ a ❬representation space❭ (or
    ❬representation❭) of $G$ ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $V$ has finite dimension $n$. ⦉

  ‖ In this case, we call $n$ the ❬degree❭ of the
    representation $ρ$. ⦉

  ‖ Given a basis $e_1, …, e_n$ of $V$, ⦉
