\section*{Definition}

A polynomial $p: \R  \to \R $ is \t{nonnegative} (a \t{nonnegative polynomial}, \t{nonnegative real polynomial}) if
\[
p(x) \geq 0 \quad \text{for all } x \in \R
\]
In this case, we call $p$ \t{positive semidefinite} or \t{PSD}.

\section*{Testing nonnegativity}

Given polynomial $p$, how do we know if $p$ is (globally) nonnegative?
Consider $p: \R  \to \R $ defined by
\[
p(x) = 5x^4 - 4x^3 - x^2 + 2x + 2
\]
We visualize the graph of $p$ below.

Given the coefficients of $p$, namely the list $(2, 2, -1, -4, 5) \in \R ^5$, how can we tell?
It is not so obvious, but if we write
\[
p(x) = (x^2 + 1)^2 + (2x^2 - x - 1)^2,
\]
then it is readily apparent that $p \geq 0$ since all squares are nonnegative.

We can ask two questions:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item If $p$ is a nonnegative polynomial, can it be written as a sum of squares?
      \item If $p$ is a sum of squares, how do we find them?
    \end{enumerate}
