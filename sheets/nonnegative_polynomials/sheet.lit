§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A polynomial $p: 𝗥 → 𝗥$ is ❬nonnegative❭ (a ❬nonnegative
    polynomial❭, ❬nonnegative real polynomial❭) if
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ p(x) ≥ 0 \quad \text{for all } x ∈ 𝗥 ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ In this case, we call $p$ ❬positive semidefinite❭ or ❬PSD❭. ⦉
⦉

§ Testing nonnegativity ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given polynomial $p$, how do we know if $p$ is (globally)
    nonnegative? ⦉

  ‖ Consider $p: 𝗥 → 𝗥$ defined by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ p(x) = 5x^4 - 4x^3 - x^2 + 2x + 2 ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ We visualize the graph of $p$ below. ⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given the coefficients of $p$, namely the list $(2, 2, -1,
    -4, 5) ∈ 𝗥^5$, how can we tell? ⦉

  ‖ It is not so obvious, but if we write
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ p(x) = (x^2 + 1)^2 + (2x^2 - x - 1)^2, ⦉
    ⦉
    then it is readily apparent that $p ≥ 0$ since all squares
    are nonnegative. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We can ask two questions:
    𝍫 ⦊
      ‣ If $p$ is a nonnegative polynomial, can it be written
        as a sum of squares? ⦉

      ‣ If $p$ is a sum of squares ⦉
