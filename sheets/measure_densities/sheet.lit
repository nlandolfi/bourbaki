§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $(X, ℱ)$ is a measurable space. ⦉

  ‖ A measure $ν: ℱ → \Rbar$ is said to have a density with
    respect to a measure $μ: ℱ → \Rbar$ if there exists a
    measurable function $f: X → 𝗥_+$
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ ν(A) = ∫_A f dμ \quad \text{for all } A ∈ ℱ ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ In this case $f$ is called a ❬density❭ of $μ$ with respect
    to $ν$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ ‹Probability on finite sets.› ⦉

  ‖ Suppose $P$ is a probability measure for a finite set $Ω$. ⦉

  ‖ Define $p: Ω → [0,1]$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ p(ω) = P(\set{ω}) \quad \text{for all } ω ∈ Ω ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Then $p$ is a probability distribution. ⦉

  ‖ Moreover, $p$ is a density for $P$ with respect to the
    counting measure $\#: \powerset{Ω} → 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ Witness, for every $A ⊂ Ω$,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \int_{A} p d\# = ∑_{a ∈ A} p(ω) ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ We recognize the right hand side as $P(A)$ by using the
    additivity of $P$. ⦉
