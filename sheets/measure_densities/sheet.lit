§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $(X, ℱ)$ is a measurable space. ⦉

  ‖ A measure $ν: ℱ → \Rbar$ is said to have a density with
    respect to a measure $μ: ℱ → \Rbar$ if there exists a
    measurable function $f: X → 𝗥_+$
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ ν(A) = ∫_A f dμ ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ In this case $f$ is called a ❬density❭ of $μ$ with respect
    to $ν$. ⦉
