\section*{Definition}

Suppose $(X, \mathcal{F} )$ is a measurable space.
A measure $\nu : \mathcal{F}  \to \Rbar$ is said to have a density with respect to a measure $\mu : \mathcal{F}  \to \Rbar$ if there exists a measurable function $f: X \to \R _+$
\[
\nu (A) = \int _A f d\mu
\]
In this case $f$ is called a \t{density} of $\mu $ with respect to $\nu $.
