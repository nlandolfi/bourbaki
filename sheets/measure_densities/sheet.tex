\section*{Definition}

Suppose $(X, \mathcal{F} )$ is a measurable space.
A measure $\mu : \mathcal{F}  \to \Rbar$ is said to have a density with respect to a measure $\nu : \mathcal{F}  \to \Rbar$ if there exists a measurable function $f: X \to \R _+$
\[
\mu (A) = \int _A f d\nu  \quad \text{for all } A \in \mathcal{F}
\]
In this case $f$ is called a \t{density} of $\mu $ with respect to $\nu $.

\subsection*{Examples}

\textit{Probability on finite sets.}
Suppose $P$ is a probability measure for a finite set $\Omega $.
Define $p: \Omega  \to [0,1]$ by
\[
p(\omega ) = P(\set{\omega }) \quad \text{for all } \omega  \in \Omega
\]
Then $p$ is a probability distribution.
Moreover, $p$ is a density for $P$ with respect to the counting measure $\#: \powerset{\Omega } \to \R $.
Witness, for every $A \subset \Omega $,
\[
\int_{A} p d\# = \sum_{a \in A} p(\omega )
\]
We recognize the right hand side as $P(A)$ by using the additivity of $P$.
