\section*{Definition}

\begin{proposition}
Suppose $\mathcal{T} _1$ and $\mathcal{T} _2$ are two topologies on a set $X$.
Then $\mathcal{T} _1 \cap  \mathcal{T} _2$ is a topology on $X$.\end{proposition}
More generally, the intersection of a family of topologies is a topology.

Now suppose we are given some set of subsets $\mathcal{B} $ of $X$.
The intersection of the set of topologies on $X$ which contain $\mathcal{B} $ is a topology on $X$.
We call this the \t{topology generated by} $\mathcal{B} $.
