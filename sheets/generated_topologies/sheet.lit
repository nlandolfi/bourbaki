§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  <statement type='proposition'>
    ‖ Suppose $𝒯_1$ and $𝒯_2$ are two topologies on a set $X$. ⦉

    ‖ Then $𝒯_1 ∩ 𝒯_2$ is a topology on $X$. ⦉
  </statement>

  ‖ More generally, the intersection of a family of topologies
    is a topology. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Now suppose we are given some set of subsets $ℬ$ of $X$. ⦉

  ‖ The intersection of the set of topologies on $X$ which
    contain $ℬ$ is a topology on $X$. ⦉

  ‖ We call this the ❬topology generated by❭ $ℬ$. ⦉
