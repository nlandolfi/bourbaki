§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We have seen that the matrices are a vector space. ⦉

  ‖ Are they an inner product space? ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬matrix scalar product❭ of $A ∈ 𝗥^{n ×k}$ and $B ∈
    𝗥^{n ×k}$ is the following product ⦉
  ◇ ⦊
    ‖ ∑_{i = 1}^{n} ∑_{j = 1}^{k} a_{ij}b_{ij}. ⦉
  ⦉

  ‖ Using the matrix trace, we can denote this as $\tr A^⊤ B$. ⦉

  ‖ Some authors call this the ❬Euclidean matrix scalar product❭,
    ❬matrix inner product❭ or ❬Frobenius inner product❭. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ The matrix scalar product is an inner product. ⦉
</statement>

‖ ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ For example, symmetry of the product is a consequence of
    the fact that a square matrix and its transpose have
    identical traces. ⦉

  ‖ Commutativity of the trace yields $\tr \transpose{A} B = \tr
    B\transpose{A}$, where the LHS is the scalar product of
    $\transpose{B}$ and $\transpose{A}$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, transposition “preserves” the matrix scalar
    product. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ With this inner product, $𝗥^{n ×k}$ is a Euclidean vector
    space (see␣
    <a href='/sheets/real_inner_products.html'>
      ‖ Inner procuts ⦉
    </a>
    ) of dimension $nk$. ⦉

  ‖ For the case of $k = 1$, we recover a model
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will define this term. ⦉
    ⦉
    for the usual space $𝗥^n$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We commonly denote the matrix inner product by $\langle A,
    B \rangle$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Induced norm ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The matrix inner product induces a norm in the usual way. ⦉

  ‖ This norm is sometimes called the ❬matrix-vector norm❭ (or
    ❬Frobenius norm❭) and is often denoted for a matrix $A ∈
    𝗥^{m × n}$ by $\norm{A}_F$. ⦉
