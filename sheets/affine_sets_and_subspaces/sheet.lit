§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ What are the affine sets in terms of subspaces? ⦉
⦉

§ Affine sets which are subspaces ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The subspaces of $𝗥^n$ are the affine sets which contain
    the origin. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ $M ⊂ 𝗥^n$ is a subspace if and only if $M$ is affine and
    $0 ∈ M$. ⦉
  <proof>
    ‖ ⦉

    ‖ ($⇒$) ⦉

    ‖ Suppose $M$ is a subspace. ⦉

    ‖ Then $0 ∈ M$. ⦉

    ‖ Also $αx + βy ∈ M$ for all $α, β ∈ 𝗥$ and $x, y ∈
      𝗥^n$ ⦉

    ‖ In particular, $(1- λ)x + λy ∈ M$ for all $λ ∈ 𝗥$, $x,
      y ∈ 𝗥^n$. ⦉

    ‖ In other words, $M$ contains the line through $x$ and $y$. ⦉

    ‖ ⦉

    ‖ ($⇐$) Suppose $M$ is affine and $0 ∈ M$. ⦉

    ‖ $M$ is closed under scalar multiplication since
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ αx = (1 - α)0 + αx ⦉
      ⦉
      is in the line through $0$ and $x$. ⦉

    ‖ $M$ is closed under vector addition since
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ (1/2)(x + y) = (1-1/2)x + (1/2)y ⦉
      ⦉
      is in the line through $x$ and $y$. ⦉

    ‖ Thus, $x+y = 2(1/2)(x+y) ∈ M$. ⦉
  </proof>
</statement>

§ Affine sets as translated subspaces ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Suppose $M ≠ ∅$ is affine. ⦉

  ‖ Then there exists a unique subspace $L$ and vector $a ∈
    𝗥^n$ for which $M = L + a$. ⦉

  ‖ Moreover,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ L = M - M = \Set{x - y}{x,y ∈ M}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
</statement>
<proof>
  ‖ First, uniqueness. ⦉

  ‖ Suppose $L_1$ and $L_2$ are subspaces parallel to $M$. ⦉

  ‖ We will show that $L_2 ⊃ L_1$ (and similarly, $L_1 ⊃ L_2$). ⦉

  ‖ ⦉

  ‖ Since $L_1$ and $L_2$ are both parallel to $M$, they are
    also parallel to each other. ⦉

  ‖ Consequently, there exists $a ∈ 𝗥^n$ with $L_2 = L_1 + a$. ⦉

  ‖ Since $0 ∈ L_2$ (it is a subspace, after all), $-a ∈ L_1$. ⦉

  ‖ Since $L_1$ is a subspace, $a ∈ L_1$. ⦉

  ‖ So $x + a ∈ L_1$ for every $a ∈ L_1$, and so $L_2 =
    L_1 + a ⊂ L_1$. ⦉

  ‖ A similar argument gives $L_1 ⊃ L_2$. ⦉

  ‖ ⦉

  ‖ If $y ∈ M$, then $M + (-y) = M - y$ is a translate of
    $M$ containing zero (since $y - y = 0$). ⦉

  ‖ In other words, the affine set $M - y$ is a subspace. ⦉

  ‖ This, then, is the unique subspace parallel to $M$. ⦉

  ‖ Since $y$ was arbitrary, the subspace parallel to $M$ is $L
    = ∪_{y ∈ M} M - y = \Set{x - y}{x,y ∈ M}$. ⦉
