\section*{Why}

What are the affine sets in terms of subspaces?

\section*{Affine sets which are subspaces}

The subspaces of $\R ^n$ are the affine sets which contain the origin.

\begin{proposition}
$M \subset \R ^n$ is a subspace if and only if $M$ is affine and $0 \in M$.
\begin{proof}

($\Rightarrow$)
Suppose $M$ is a subspace.
Then $0 \in M$.
Also $\alpha x + \beta y \in M$ for all $\alpha , \beta  \in \R $ and $x, y \in \R ^n$
In particular, $(1- \lambda )x + \lambda y \in M$ for all $\lambda  \in \R $, $x, y \in \R ^n$.
In other words, $M$ contains the line through $x$ and $y$.

($\Leftarrow$) Suppose $M$ is affine and $0 \in M$.
$M$ is closed under scalar multiplication since
  \[
\alpha x = (1 - \alpha )0 + \alpha x
  \]
is in the line through $0$ and $x$.
$M$ is closed under vector addition since
  \[
(1/2)(x + y) = (1-1/2)x + (1/2)y
  \]
is in the line through $x$ and $y$.
Thus, $x+y = 2(1/2)(x+y) \in M$.
\end{proof}
\end{proposition}

\section*{Affine sets as translated subspaces}

\begin{proposition}
Suppose $M \neq \varnothing$ is affine.
Then there exists a unique subspace $L$ and vector $a \in \R ^n$ for which $M = L + a$.
Moreover,
  \[
L = M - M = \Set{x - y}{x,y \in M}.
  \]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
First, uniqueness.
Suppose $L_1$ and $L_2$ are subspaces parallel to $M$.
We will show that $L_2 \supset L_1$ (and similarly, $L_1 \supset L_2$).

Since $L_1$ and $L_2$ are both parallel to $M$, they are also parallel to each other.
Consequently, there exists $a \in \R ^n$ with $L_2 = L_1 + a$.
Since $0 \in L_2$ (it is a subspace, after all), $-a \in L_1$.
Since $L_1$ is a subspace, $a \in L_1$.
So $x + a \in L_1$ for every $a \in L_1$, and so $L_2 = L_1 + a \subset L_1$.
A similar argument gives $L_1 \supset L_2$.

If $y \in M$, then $M + (-y) = M - y$ is a translate of $M$ containing zero (since $y - y = 0$).
In other words, the affine set $M - y$ is a subspace.
This, then, is the unique subspace parallel to $M$.
Since $y$ was arbitrary, the subspace parallel to $M$ is $L = \cup_{y \in M} M - y = \Set{x - y}{x,y \in M}$.

\end{proof}
