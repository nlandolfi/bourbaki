§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to arrange the elements of a set in an order
    using only the concept of sets.

§ Discussion ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ What does this mean? Well, we often arrange objects in
    orders. ⦉

  ‖ For example, the letters of this page are arranged into
    words. ⦉

  ‖ Take two such words: ‘note’ and ‘tone’. ⦉

  ‖ If letters are objects, what are words? ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A first guess is that words seem like groups of letters,
    and sets seem like groups, and so a word is a set of
    letters. ⦉

  ‖ So, the word ‘note’ is the set {'n', ‘o’, ‘t’, ‘e’}, and
    then word ‘tone’ is the set {‘t’, ‘o’, ‘n’, ‘e’}. ⦉

  ‖ The rub, of course, is that these are the same set. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The trick is that a word is not just the set of letters,
    it is that set in some order. ⦉

  ‖ Since ‘tone’ and ‘note’ have the same letters, they have
    the same set of letters. ⦉

  <!-- Since $\set{\text{‘n}}, \text{‘o}}, \text{‘t}}, \text{‘e}}}$ denotes the same set as $\set{\text{‘t}}, \text{‘o}}, \text{‘n}}, \text{‘e}}}$ and both these denote the same set as $\set{\text{‘e}}, \text{‘t}}, \text{‘o}}, \text{‘n}}}$. -->

  ‖ The question is whether there is a way of saying what a
    word is in terms of letters by using sets in such a way
    that the set corresponding to ‘tone’ is distinguishable from
    the set corresponding to ‘note’. ⦉
⦉

<!-- %TODO(next edition): single quotes represent words and letters -->
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The way we read English offers a hint. ⦉

  ‖ When reading ‘tone’ we scan from left to right seeing ‘t’,
    then ‘to’, then ‘ton’ then ‘tone’. ⦉

  ‖ Suppose that for each spot in the ordering of the letters,
    we consider those letters that appear at or before the spot. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, we can consider the sets {‘t’}, {‘t’, ‘o’},
    {‘t’, ‘o’, ‘n’}, {‘t’, ‘o’, ‘n’, ‘e’}. ⦉

  ‖ Let us say that ‘tone’ corresponds to the set of these
    sets, denoted by $𝒞$,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ 𝒞 = \set{\set{n, o, t}, \set{n, o, t, e}, \set{t},
        \set{o, t}}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given $𝒞$, can we recover ‘tone’ (instead of ‘note’)? ⦉

  ‖ Sure. ⦉

  ‖ First, look for a set contained in all the others. ⦉

  ‖ The singleton {‘t’} is the only one. ⦉

  ‖ So the first letter is ‘t’. ⦉

  ‖ Next look for a set distinct from ‘t’ which is contained
    in all the rest. ⦉

  ‖ The pair {‘o’, ‘t’} is the only one. ⦉

  ‖ Since we already have ‘t’, the next letter is ‘o’. ⦉

  ‖ We do the same twice more, getting ‘n’ and ‘e’, in that
    order. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ There is a certain peculiarity in all these considerations. ⦉

  ‖ Every time we write down a set, we write the names (see
    \sheetref{names}{Names}) of the elements in some order. ⦉

  ‖ Indeed, whenever we speak of objects, we must say their
    names in some order. ⦉

  ‖ But of course, no matter how we denote or speak of the
    set, the concept of set has no concept of ordering. ⦉
⦉

§ Generally ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ denote objects, no two of which
    are the same (i.e., $a ≠ b$, $b ≠ c$, etc.). ⦉

  ‖ Suppose we want to consider the elements of the quadruple
    $\set{a, b, c, d}$ in the order $c$, $b$, $d$, $a$. ⦉

  ‖ We include in the set all objects that that occur at or
    before that position. ⦉

  ‖ For the order $c$, $b$, $d$, $a$ of the objects in the
    set $\set{a, b, c, d}$ we use $\set{c}$, $\set{c, b}$,
    $\set{c, b, d}$ and $\set{c, b, d, a}$. ⦉
⦉
