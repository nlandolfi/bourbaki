\ssection{Why}
We can identify probability distributions with vectors.

\ssection{Definition}
Let $p: A \to \R$ be a probability distribution on a set finite $A$ of $n$ elements.
Given a numbering $a: \set{1, \dots, n} \to A$ of $A$, we can associate $p$ with the vector $z \in \R^n$ defined by $z_i = p(a_i)$.
We call this vector $z$ the \t{probability vector} associated with $p$.
