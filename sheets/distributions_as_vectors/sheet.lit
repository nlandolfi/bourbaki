  ‖ We can identify probability distributions with vectors. ⦉

‖ \ssection{Definition}⦉
  ‖ Let $p: A → 𝗥$ be a probability distribution on a set
    finite $A$ of $n$ elements. ⦉

  ‖ Given a numbering $a: \set{1, …, n} → A$ of $A$, we can
    associate $p$ with the vector $z ∈ 𝗥^n$ defined by $z_i =
    p(a_i)$. ⦉

  ‖ We call this vector $z$ the ❬probability vector❭ associated
    with $p$. ⦉
