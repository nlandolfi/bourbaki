\ssection{Why}

The squared norm of a sum of
orthogonal vectors is
the sum of their squared norms.

\ssection{Result}

\begin{prop}
  Let $(V, F)$ be an inner
  product space with induced
  norm $\norm{\cdot}$.
  Let $x, y \in V$
  be orthgonal vector.
  Then
  \[
    \norm{x + y}^2 = \norm{x}^2 + \norm{y}^2.
  \]
\end{prop}
