Well, least squares, for instance.\footnote{Future editions will expand this description.}

\ssection{Definition}

An \t{orthogonal triangular decomposition} (or \t{orthogonal triangular factorization}) of a $A \in \C^{m \times n}$ with $m \geq n$ is an ordered pair of matrices $(Q, R)$ where $Q$ is orthogonal and $R$ is upper triangular and
\[
  A = QR.
\]
This is universally known as a \t{QR factorization} or \t{QR decomposition}.
