§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ An ❬orthogonal triangular decomposition❭ (or ❬orthogonal
    triangular factorization❭) of a $A ∈ 𝗖^{m ×n}$ with $m ≥ n$
    is an ordered pair of matrices $(Q, R)$ where $Q$ is
    orthogonal and $R$ is upper triangular and
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ A = QR. ⦉
    ⦉

    ‖ This is universally known as a ❬QR factorization❭ or ❬QR
