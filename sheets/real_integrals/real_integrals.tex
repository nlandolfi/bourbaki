\stitle{Real Integrals}

\ssection{Why}

We define the area
under an extended
real function.

\ssection{Definition}

The
\ct{positive part}{positivepart}
of an extended-real-valued function
is the function mapping
each element to
the maximum of the function's
result and zero.
The
\ct{negative part}{negativepart}
of an extended-real-valued function
is the function mapping
each element to the maximum
of the negative of function's
result and zero.

We decompose
an extended-real-valued
function as
the difference of
its positive part
and its negative part.
Both the positive and
negative parts
are non-negative
extended-real-valued
functions.

Consider a measure space.
An
\ct{integrable}{integrable}
function
is a measurable
extended real function
for which
the non-negative integral
of the posititve part
and the non-negative integral
of the negative part of
the function are finite.

The \ct{integral}{realintegral}
of an integrable function
is the difference
of the non-negative integral
of the posititive part and
and the non-negative integral
of the negative part.

If one but not both
of the parts of the function
are finite, we say that the
integral
\ct{exists}{integralexists}
and again define it as before.
in this
way we avoid arithmetic
between two infinities.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $A$ a non-empty set.
Let $g: A \to [-\infty, \infty]$.
We denote the positive part
of $g$ by $g^+$ and the negative
part of $g$ by $g^-$:
\[
  g^+(x) = \max\set{g(x), 0} \quad \text{ and } \quad g^-(x) = \max\set{-g(x), 0}.
\]
Moreover, we decompose
$g$
as
$g = g^+ - g^-$.
We observed that
$g^+(x) \geq 0$ and
$g^-(x) \geq 0$
for all $x \in X$.

Let $(X, \mathcal{A}, \mu)$
be a measure space.
Let $f: X \to [-\infty, +\infty]$
measurable and
one of
$\int f^+ d \mu$ or
$\int f^- d \mu$
is finite
(if both are finite,
$f$ is integrable).

We denote the integral
of $f$ with respect to the
measure $\mu$ by
$\int f d \mu$.
We defined:
\[
  \int f d\mu = \left(\int f^+ d\mu\right) - \left(\int f^- d\mu\right).
\]
