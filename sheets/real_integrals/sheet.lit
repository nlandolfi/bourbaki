§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We define the area under an extended real function. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬positive part❭ of an extended-real-valued function is
    the function mapping each element to the maximum of the
    function’s result and zero. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬negative part❭ of an extended-real-valued function is
    the function mapping each element to the maximum of the
    additive inverse of function's result and zero. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We decompose an extended-real-valued function as the
    difference of its positive part and its negative part. ⦉

  ‖ Both the positive and negative parts are non-negative
    extended-real-valued functions. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Consider a measure space. ⦉

  ‖ An ❬integrable❭ function is a measurable extended-real-valued
    function for which the non-negative integral of the posititve
    part and the non-negative integral of the negative part of
    the function are finite. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬integral❭ of an integrable function is the difference
    of the non-negative integral of the posititive part and and
    the non-negative integral of the negative part. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ If one but not both of the parts of the function are
    finite, we say that the integral ❬exists❭ and again define
    it as before. ⦉

  ‖ In this way we avoid arithmetic between two infinities. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A$ a non-empty set. ⦉

  ‖ Let $g: A → [-∞, ∞]$. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the positive part ⦉

  ‖ of $g$ by $g^+$ and the negative ⦉

  ‖ part of $g$ by $g^-$:
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ g^+(x) = \max\set{g(x), 0} \quad \text{ and } \quad
        g^-(x) = \max\set{-g(x), 0}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Moreover, we decompose $g$ as $g = g^+ - g^-$. ⦉

  ‖ We observed that $g^+(x) ≥ 0$ and $g^-(x) ≥ 0$ for all $x
    ∈ X$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ be a measure space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $f: X → [-∞, +∞]$ measurable and one of $∫ f^+ d μ$
    or $∫ f^- d μ$ is finite (if both are finite, $f$ is
    integrable). ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the integral of $f$ with respect to the measure
    $μ$ by $∫ f d μ$. ⦉

  ‖ We defined:
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ ∫ f dμ = \left(∫ f^+ dμ\right) - \left(∫ f^- dμ\right). ⦉
