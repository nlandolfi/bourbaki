§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A square real matrix is ❬symmetric❭ (we call it a a
    ❬symmetric matrix❭) if its values do not depend on the order
    of the indices. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, a matrix is symmetric if the values above
    and below the diagonal are a mirror image. ⦉
⦉

§§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The matrix
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \bmat{1 ❲&❳ 2 ᜶ 2 ❲&❳ 3} ⦉
    ⦉
    is symmetric. ⦉

  ‖ The matrix
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \bmat{1 ❲&❳ 2 ᜶ 3 ❲&❳ 4} ⦉
    ⦉
    is not. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ $A ∈ 𝗥^{n × n}$ is symmetric means $A^⊤ = A$. ⦉
