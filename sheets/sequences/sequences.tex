\stitle{Sequences}

\ssection{Why}

We introduce language
for the steps of an
infinite process.

\ssection{Definition}

Let $A$ be a non-empty
set.
A \ct{sequence in $A$}{},
  or \ct{sequence of
    elements in $A$},
is a function
from the natural numbers to the
set.
The \ct{$n$th term}{} of a sequence
is the result of $n$th natural
number; it is an element of
the set.

A \ct{subindex}{} is a monotonically
increasing function from and to the
natural numbers.
Roughly,
it
selects some ordered infinite
subset of natural numbers.
A \ct{subsequence}{} of a first
sequence is any second sequence
which is the composition of the
first sequence with a subindex.


Another way of describing a sequence
is as an element of the direct product
of a family of indentical sets indexed
by the natural numbers.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Keep $A$ as a non-empty set.
Denote the natural numbers by $N$.
Let $a: N \to A$.
Then $a$ is a sequence and
$a(n)$ is the $n$th term.
We denote $a$ by
$\seq{a}$ and $a(n)$ by $\seqt{a}$.

Let $i: N \to N$ such that
$n < m \implies i(n) < i(m)$.
Then $i$ is a subindex.
Let $b = a \comp i$.
Then $b$ is a subsequence of $a$.
We denote it by
$\set{b_{i(n)}}_n$ and the $n$th
term by $b_{i(n)}$.
