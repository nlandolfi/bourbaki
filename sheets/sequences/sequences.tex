\ssection{Why}

We introduce language
for the steps of an
infinite process.

\ssection{Definition}

A \ct{sequence}{} is a function
from the natural numbers to a
set.

Equivalently, a sequence is an element
of a direct product of a family
of sets for which each set in the
family
is identical and the index set is
the natural numbers.
