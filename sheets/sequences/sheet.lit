  ‖ \ssection{Why} ⦉

  ‖ We want to speak of infinite processes, and to do so we
    define sequences indexed by $\N$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, important families are those indexed by the
    natural numbers. ⦉

⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬sequence❭ (❬infinite sequence❭) is a family whose index
    set is $𝗡$ (the set of natural numbers without zero). ⦉

  ‖ The ❬$n$th term❭ or ❬coordinate❭ of a sequence is the
    result of the $n$th natural number, $n ∈ 𝗡$.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions may also comment that we are introducing
        language for the steps of an infinite process. ⦉

⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A$ be a non-empty set and $a: 𝗡 → A$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $a$ is a (infinite) sequence in $A$. ⦉

  ‖ $a(n)$ is the $n$th term. ⦉

  ‖ We also denote $a$ by $\seq{a}$ and $a(n)$ by $\seqt{a}$. ⦉

  ‖ If $\set{A_n}_{n ∈ 𝗡}$ is an infinite sequence of sets,
    then we denote the direct product of the sequence by $∏_{i
    = 1}^{∈fty} A_i$. ⦉

⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the family of the infinite sequence of sets
    $\seq{A}$ by $\union_{i = 1}^{\infty} A_i$. ⦉

  ‖ Similarly, we denote the intersection of an infinite sequence
    of sets
    by $\intersection_{i
    = 1}^{\infty} A_i$, respectively. ⦉
