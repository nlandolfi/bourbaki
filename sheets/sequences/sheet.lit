§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to speak of infinite processes, and to do so we
    define sequences indexed by $𝗡$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, important families are those indexed by the
    natural numbers. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬sequence❭ (or ❬infinite sequence❭) is a family whose
    index set is $𝗡$ (the set of natural numbers without zero). ⦉

  ‖ The ❬$n$th term❭ or ❬coordinate❭ of a sequence is the
    result of the $n$th natural number, $n ∈ 𝗡$.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions may also comment that we are introducing
        language for the steps of an infinite process. ⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A$ be a non-empty set and $a: 𝗡 → A$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $a$ is a (infinite) sequence in $A$. ⦉

  ‖ $a(n)$ is the $n$th term. ⦉

  ‖ We also denote $a$ by $\seq{a}$ and $a(n)$ by $\seqt{a}$. ⦉

  ‖ If $\set{A_n}_{n ∈ 𝗡}$ is an infinite sequence of sets,
    then we denote the direct product of the sequence by $∏_{i
    = 1}^{∞} A_i$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Sometimes the set of infinite sequences in $A$ are denoted
    $A^𝗡$ or $A^∞$. ⦉
⦉

§ Natural unions and intersections ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the family of the infinite sequence of sets
    $\seq{A}$ by $∪_{i = 1}^{∞} A_i$. ⦉

  ‖ Similarly, we denote the intersection of an infinite sequence
    of sets by $∩_{i = 1}^{∞} A_i$, respectively. ⦉
