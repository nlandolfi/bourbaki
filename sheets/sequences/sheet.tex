\ssection{Why}

We introduce language for the steps of an infinite process.

\ssection{Definition}

A \t{finite sequence} is a family whose index set is a natural number (excluding zero).
An \t{infinite sequence} is a family whose index set is the set of natural numbers (without zero).
The \t{$n$th term} of a sequence (finite or infinite) is the result of the $n$th natural number.
Let $A$ be a non-empty set.
A sequence \t{in} $A$ is a function from the natural numbers to the set.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $A$ be a non-empty set.
Let $a: \N \to A$
Then $a$ is a sequence in $A$.
$a(n)$ is the $n$th term.
We also denote $a$ by
$\seq{a}$ and $a(n)$ by $\seqt{a}$.

% TODO: integrate, from direct products
%
% If $I$ is the set of natural numbers we denote the direct product by
% \[
%   \product_{i = 1}^{\infty} A_{i}.
% \]
% We denote an element of $\product_{i = 1}^{\infty} A_{i}$ by $(a_i)$ with the understanding that $a_i \in A_i$ for all $i = 1,2,3,\dots$.
% If $A_i = A$ for all $i = 1, 2, 3,\dots$, then $(a_i)$ is a sequence in $A$.
