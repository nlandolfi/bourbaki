\section*{Why}
\footnote{Future editions will include, and will likely continue to higher degree equations.}
\section*{Definition}

Let $f(x)$ be a first-order polynomial.
In other words, there exists $\alpha , \beta  \in \R $ so that $f(x) = \alpha  x + \beta $.
Then $f(x) = 0$ is a a \t{first degree equation}.
