§ Why ⦉
† ⦊
  ‖ Future editions will include, and will likely continue to
    higher degree equations. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $f: 𝗥 → 𝗥$ is a first-order polynomial. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, there are coefficients $α, β ∈ 𝗥$, $α ≠
    0$, so that $f(x) = α x + β$ for every $x ∈ 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $f(x) = 0$ is a ❬first degree equation❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We write
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ αx + β = 0 ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Notice that we can divide through by $α$ to obtain,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ x + (β/α) = 0 ⦉

§§ Solutions ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given a real number $a ∈ 𝗥$, suppose we want to find $x
    ∈ 𝗥$ so that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ x + a = 0 ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Clearly, $x = -a$ is a solution. ⦉
