§ Why ⦉
† ⦊
  ‖ Future editions will include, and will likely continue to
    higher degree equations. ⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $f(x)$ be a first-order polynomial. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, there exists $α, β ∈ 𝗥$ so that $f(x) =
    α x + β$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $f(x) = 0$ is a a ❬first degree equation❭. ⦉
