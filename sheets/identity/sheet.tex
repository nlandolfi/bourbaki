\ssection{Why}

We can give the
same object two different
names.

\ssection{Definition}

An object
\ct{is}{} itself.
If the object that two
names refer to is
the same,
then we say
that the first name
\ct{equals}{}
the second name.

\ssubsection{Notation}

We denote that
the object named $a$ and
the object named $b$ refer
to the same object
by $a = b$,
read aloud as:
\say{a is b.}
We denote that
the object $a$ and
$b$ refer to different
objects by $a \neq b$,
read aloud as:
\say{a is not b.}

We may also read the notation
$a = b$ aloud as \say{a
equals b}.
Other English readings
include: \say{a is the
same as b},
\say{a is equivalent
to b},
\say{a refers to
the same object
as b.}
