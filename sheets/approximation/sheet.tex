\ssection{Why}

Often we want to find an object of a set which is similar to a give object of a superset.
In other words, we are given an object in some set.
And, within a subset of that set, we want to find an object which is most similar to the given object.

\ssection{Definition}

\t{Approximation} is a mathematical optimization problemin which we find an element (from a given subset) which is similar to a particular element of a set.
We call an element of the the subset an \t{approximant}.
