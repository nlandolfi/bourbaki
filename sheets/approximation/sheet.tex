\ssection{Why}

We are given an object of some set, and what to find an element (in some subset) which is most similar to it.

\ssection{Definition}

\t{Approximation} is a mathematical optimization problemin which we find an element (from a given subset) which is similar to a particular element of a set.
We call an element of the the subset an \t{approximant}.
