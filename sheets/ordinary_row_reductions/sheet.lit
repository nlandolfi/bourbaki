§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ When does the technique of row reductions prevail? ⦉
⦉

§§ Multivariable row reductions ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $S = (A ∈ 𝗥^{m ×m}, b ∈ 𝗥^{m})$ be a linear system
    with $A_{kk} ≠ 0$. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬$k$th row reduction❭ of $S$ is the linear system $(C,
    d)$ with $C_{st} = A_{st} - (A_{sk}/A_{kk})A_{kt}$ if $i < s
    ≤ m$ and $C_{st} = A_{st}$ otherwise. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The idea, as in the example in␣
    <a href='/sheets/linear_system_row_reductions.html'>
      ‖ Linear System Row Reductions ⦉
    </a>
    , is to eliminate variable $k$ from equations $k+1, …, m$. ⦉

  ‖ We are taking the $k$th column of $A$ from
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \barray{A_{1k} ᜶ ⋮ ᜶ A_{kk} ᜶ A_{k+1,k} ᜶ ⋮ ᜶ A_{mk}}
        \quad \text{to} \quad \barray{A_{1k} ᜶ ⋮ ᜶ A_{kk} ᜶ 0 ᜶
        ⋮ ᜶ 0}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We interpret the $i$th row reduction as ❬subtracting
    equations❭ of the system or ❬reducing rows❭ of the array $A$. ⦉

  ‖ If $a^i, c^i ∈ 𝗥^{n}$ denote the $i$th rows of $A$ and
    $C$, $c^i = a^i - (A_{ik}/A_{kk})a^k$ for $k < i ≤ m$, ⦉

  ‖ In other words, we obtain the $i$th row of matrix $C$ by
    subtracting a multiple of the $k$th row of matrix $A$ from
    the $i$th row of matrix $A$, for $k < i ≤ m$. ⦉

  ‖ The following is an immediate consequence of real arithmetic. ⦉
⦉

<statement id='proposition:ordinaryrowreductions:basic' type='proposition'>
  ‖ Let $(A ∈ 𝗥^{m × n}, b ∈ 𝗥^{n})$ be a linear system
    which row reduces to $(C, d)$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $x ∈ 𝗥^{n}$ is a solution of $(A, b)$ if and only
    if it is a solution of $(C, d)$. ⦉
</statement>

§ Ordinary reductions ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We call the system $S$ ❬ordinarily reducible❭ if there
    exists a sequence of systems $S_1, …, S_{m-1}$ so that $S_1$
    is the $11$-reduction of $S$ and $S_{i}$ is the
    $ii$-reduction of $S_{i-1}$ for $i = 1, …, n-1$. ⦉

  ‖ In this case, we call $S_{n-1}$ the ❬final ordinary
    reduction❭ (or just ❬ordinary reduction❭) of $S$. ⦉

  ‖ The following is an immediate consequence of
    Proposition~\ref{proposition:ordinaryrowreductions:basic}. ⦉
  <statement id='proposition:ordinary_row_reductions:main' type='proposition'>
    ‖ Let $S'$ be the (final) ordinary reduction of $S$. Then
      $S$ and $S'$ have equivalent solution sets. ⦉
  </statement>
⦉

‖ This process of constructing the ordinary reduction is called
  ❬Gauss elimination❭ or ❬Gaussian elimination❭. ⦉

‖ We call the $kk$th entry of system $S_{k-1}$ the ❬pivot❭. ⦉

‖ In an ordinarily reducible system, the pivots are nonzero. ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The idea is that a system is ordinarily reducible if we
    can take row reductions in sequence and end up with a
    system that is easy to back-substitute and solve. ⦉

  ‖ The difficulty is that this need not be the case. ⦉

  ‖ For example, consider the following obvious difficulty. ⦉

  ‖ The system $(A, b)$ in which
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ A = \barray{0 ＆ 1᜶1 ＆ 2} \text{ and } \barray{1 ᜶ 2} ⦉
    ⦉
    is not ordinarily reducible, but clearly solvable. ⦉
