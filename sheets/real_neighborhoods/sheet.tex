\section*{Why}

Often when speaking of a set, we are interested in speaking of those elements which are close to it.

\section*{Definition}

Let $x \in \R ^d$
A subset $N \subset \R ^d$ is a \t{neighborhood of $x$} if there is a $\delta  > 0$ such that $B(x, \delta ) \subset N$.
The set $\mathcal{N} _a$ of neighboords of $x$ is called the \t{complete system of neighborhoods} of the point $a$.

We interpret a neighborhood of a point $x \in X$ as a set containing all the points of $X$ that are sufficiently close to $a$.
A neighborhood of $x$ \say{encloses} $x$ by virtue of it containing an open ball about $a$.\footnote{Future editions will continue to treatment, including pointing out that an open ball at $x$ is a neighborhood of $x$ \textit{and} of all elements in the ball.}
