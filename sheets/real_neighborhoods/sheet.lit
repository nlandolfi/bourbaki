¬ß Why ‚¶â
¬∂ ‚¶ä
  ‚Äñ Often when speaking of a set, we are interested in speaking
    of those elements which are close to it. ‚¶â
‚¶â

¬ß Definition ‚¶â
¬∂ ‚¶ä
  ‚Äñ Let $x ‚àà ùó•^d$ ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ A subset $N ‚äÇ ùó•^d$ is a ‚ù¨neighborhood of $x$‚ù≠ if there is
    a $Œ¥ > 0$ such that $B(x, Œ¥) ‚äÇ N$. ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ The set $ùí©_a$ of neighboords of $x$ is called the ‚ù¨complete
    system of neighborhoods‚ù≠ of the point $a$. ‚¶â
‚¶â

¬∂ ‚¶ä
  ‚Äñ We interpret a neighborhood of a point $x ‚àà X$ as a set
    containing all the points of $X$ that are sufficiently close
    to $a$. ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ A neighborhood of $x$ ‚Äúencloses‚Äù $x$ by virtue of it
    containing an open ball about $a$.
    ‚Ä† ‚¶ä
      ‚Äñ Future editions will continue to treatment, including
        pointing out that an open ball at $x$ is a neighborhood
        of $x$ ‚Äπand‚Ä∫ of all elements in the ball. ‚¶â
