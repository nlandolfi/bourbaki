§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given a number $n ∈ 𝗡$, a ❬factorization❭ $π = (π_1, …,
    π_p)$ of $n$ is a list of numbers (in $𝗡$) satisfying
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ n = π_1π_2⋯π_p ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ We say that the factorization $π$ ❬factors❭ $n$ and we call
    $π_i$ a ❬factor❭, and refer to $\set{π_i}$ as the ❬factors❭. ⦉
