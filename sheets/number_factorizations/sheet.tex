\section*{Definition}

Given a number $n \in \N  $, a \t{factorization} $\pi  = (\pi _1, \dots , \pi _p)$ of $n$ is a list of numbers (in $\N  $) satisfying
\[
n = \pi _1\pi _2\cdots\pi _p
\]
We say that the factorization $\pi $ \t{factors} $n$ and we call $\pi _i$ a \t{factor}, and refer to $\set{\pi _i}$ as the \t{factors}.
