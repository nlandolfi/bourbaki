¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to summarize a dataset in $\R$ with a density. ⦉

⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬likelihood❭ (or ❬density likelihood❭) of a density $f:
    𝗥 → \R$ on a datset $x^1, …, x^n ∈ \R$ is $∏_{k = 1}^{n}
    f(x^k)$. ⦉

  ‖ A ❬maximum likelihood density❭ is a density which maximizes
    the likelihood among all densities. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ As with probability distributions, we say that we are
    selecting the distribution according to the ❬maximum likelihood
    principle❭. ⦉

  ‖ In general, we call any function from datasets to densities
    a ❬density selector❭. ⦉
