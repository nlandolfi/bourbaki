\section*{Why}

We want to summarize a dataset in $\R$ with a density.

\section*{Definition}

The \t{likelihood} (or \t{density likelihood}) of a density $f: \R  \to \R$ on a datset $x^1, \dots , x^n \in \R$ is $\prod_{k = 1}^{n} f(x^k)$.
A \t{maximum likelihood density} is a density which maximizes the likelihood among all densities.

As with probability distributions, we say that we are selecting the distribution according to the \t{maximum likelihood principle}.
In general, we call any function from datasets to densities a \t{density selector}.
