%!name:common_sense

Obviously, we need language
in order to talk about anything
in these sheets.
Likewise, we need some common
sense notions.

At present, I do not see how to
define these. And I'm not sure
it would add very much to the project.

\begin{enumerate}
\item the past, the present, the future
\item the former and the latter
\end{enumerate}
