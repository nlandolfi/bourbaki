§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to generalize the construction of cover area as
    generated as a product of two cover lengths, and more
    generally for arbitrary measure spaces.

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Consider two measurable spaces. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬product base set❭ is the cartesian product of the
    first base set with the second base set. ⦉

  ‖ A first distinguished set is a distinguished set of the
    first measurable space, and likewise for a second
    distinguished set. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬rectangle with measurable sides❭ is a set in product
    base set which is a product of a first distinguished set
    with a second distinguished set. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬product sigma algebra❭ is the sigma algebra generated
    by the rectangles with measurable sides. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬product measurable space❭ is the measurable space whose
    base set is the product base set and whose sigma algebra is
    the product sigma algebra. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜)$ and $(Y, ℬ)$ be measurable spaces. ⦉

  ‖ The product base set is $X × Y$. ⦉

  ‖ A set $R ∈ X × Y$ is a rectangle with measurable sides
    if $R = A × B$ for $A ∈ 𝒜$ and $B ∈ ℬ$. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the product sigma algebra of $𝒜$ and $ℬ$ by $𝒜
    × ℬ$. ⦉

  ‖ $(X × Y, 𝒜 × ℬ)$ is the product measurable space. ⦉
