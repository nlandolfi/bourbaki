\section*{Why}

We want to generalize the construction of cover area as generated as a product of two cover lengths, and more generally for arbitrary measure spaces.\footnote{Future editions will expand.}

\section*{Definition}

Consider two measurable spaces.
The \t{product base set} is the cartesian product of the first base set with the second base set.
A first distinguished set is a distinguished set of the first measurable space, and likewise for a second distinguished set.

A \t{rectangle with measurable sides} is a set in product base set which is a product of a first distinguished set with a second distinguished set.
The \t{product sigma algebra} is the sigma algebra generated by the rectangles with measurable sides.

The \t{product measurable space} is the measurable space whose base set is the product base set and whose sigma algebra is the product sigma algebra.

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $(X, \mathcal{A} )$ and $(Y, \mathcal{B} )$ be measurable spaces.
The product base set is $X \times  Y$.
A set $R \in X \times  Y$ is a rectangle with measurable sides if $R = A \times  B$ for $A \in \mathcal{A} $ and $B \in \mathcal{B} $.
We denote the product sigma algebra of $\mathcal{A} $ and $\mathcal{B} $ by $\mathcal{A}  \times  \mathcal{B} $.
$(X \times  Y, \mathcal{A}  \times  \mathcal{B} )$ is the product measurable space.
