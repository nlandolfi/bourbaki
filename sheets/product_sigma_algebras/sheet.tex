\ssection{Why}

We want to generalize the construction of cover area as generated as a product of two cover lengths, and more generally for arbitrary measure spaces.\footnote{Future editions will expand.}

\ssection{Definition}

Consider two measurable spaces.
The \t{product base set} is
the cartesian product of
the first base set with
the second base set.
A first distinguished set
is a distinguished set
of the first measurable space,
and likewise for a second distinguished set.

A \t{rectangle with measurable sides} is a set in product base set which is a product of a first distinguished set with a second distinguished set.
The \t{product sigma algebra} is the sigma algebra generated by the rectangles with measurable sides.

The \t{product measurable space} is the measurable space whose base set is the product base set and whose sigma algebra is the product sigma algebra.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(X, \SA)$ and $(Y, \SB)$ be measurable spaces.
The product base set is $X \cross Y$.
A set $R \in X \cross Y$ is a rectangle with measurable sides if $R = A \cross B$ for $A \in \SA$ and $B \in \SB$.
We denote the product sigma algebra of $\SA$ and $\SB$ by $\SA \cross \SB$.
$(X \cross Y, \SA \cross \SB)$ is the product measurable space.
