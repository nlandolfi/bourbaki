\s{Why}

We want to visualize function composition.

\ssection{Definition}

Let $G$ be a graph (directed or undirected) on $\set{1, \dots, n}$ and let $A_1, \dots, A_n$ be a sequence of sets.
We call the ordered pair $(G, A)$ a \t{typed graph}.
We call $A_i$ the \t{$i$th domain}.
For $S \subset \set{1, \dots, n}$, we denote the ordered product $\prod_{s \in S} A_s$ by $A_S$.

If $G$ is directed, we call a source vertex $i$ \t{exogenous} and otherwise we call a vertex \t{endogenous}.

Let $\bar{G} = (G, A)$ be a typed graph where $G$ is directed.
Let $f_i: A_{\pa_{i}} \to A_i$ for $i = 1, \dots, n$ so that $f$ is a sequence of functions.
We call the ordered pair $(\bar{G}, f)$ a \t{function graph}\footnote{This sheet is not to be confused with the graph of a function (see \sheetref{functions}{Functions}.} (or \t{function diagram}).
