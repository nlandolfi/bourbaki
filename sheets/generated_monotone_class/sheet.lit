§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $X$ is a set and $𝒞$ is a set of ‹subsets› of
    $X$. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬generated monotone class❭ of $𝒞$ is the smallest
    monotone class containing the $𝒞$. ⦉

  ‖ We can show that such monotone class exists and is unique. ⦉

  ‖ This is the content of the following proposition. ⦉
