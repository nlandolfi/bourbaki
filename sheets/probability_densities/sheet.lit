¶ ⦊
  ‖ The principal difficulty is assigning nonzero numbers to
    infinitely many elements of a set. ⦉

  ‖ The solution is instead to assign probabilities to the
    ‹events› of outcomes, not to the individual outcomes
    (elementary events, real numbers), themselves. ⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬probability density❭ (or ❬probability density function❭
    (❬pdf❭)) is a function $f: 𝗥 → 𝗥$ satisfying $f ≥ 0$ and
    $∫ f = 1$. ⦉
