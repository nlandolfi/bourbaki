§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ What if the set of outcomes is the real line, $𝗥$? ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The principal difficulty is assigning nonzero numbers to
    infinitely many elements of a set. ⦉

  ‖ The solution is instead to assign probabilities to the
    ‹events› of outcomes, not to the individual outcomes
    (elementary events, real numbers), themselves. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬probability density❭ (or ❬probability density function❭
    (❬pdf❭)) is a function $f: 𝗥 → 𝗥 $ satisfying $f ≥ 0$ and
    $∫ f = 1$. ⦉
