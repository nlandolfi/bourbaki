\ssection{Why}

We want to talk about probability over measurable (not necessarily finite)
  sets.
We will use our intuition from probability distributions.

\ssection{Definition}

The principal difficulty is
assigning nonzero numbers to
infinitely many elements of
a set.

Consider the set of natural
numbers. suppo
Suppose the set
that we can not assign nonzero
probability to each element of
the set. There are infinitely
many, and so
We can not assign nonzero
probability to each individual
element of the set, since there
are infinitely many it would
never normalize.
Instead, we assign probability
to subsets of the set.
In other words, we associate
a measure with the set.
The measure is normalized, meaning
that the measure of the whole set,
the event corresponding
to any outcome occuring is 1.


A \t{probability density} (or \t{probability density function}, \t{pdf}) is a real-valued function from a set of outcomes which is non-negative and normalized.
A real-valued function on measurable space is \t{normalized} if the measure if its integral over the space is 1.
