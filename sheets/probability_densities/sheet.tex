\section*{Why}

What if the set of outcomes is the real line, $\R $?

\section*{Definition}

The principal difficulty is assigning nonzero numbers to infinitely many elements of a set.
The solution is instead to assign probabilities to the \textit{events} of outcomes, not to the individual outcomes (elementary events, real numbers), themselves.

A \t{probability density} (or \t{probability density function} (\t{pdf})) is a function $f: \R  \to \R  $ satisfying $f \geq 0$ and $\int  f = 1$.
