\ssection{Why}

We want to talk about
probability over infinite
sets.
We can not assign nonzero
probability to each individual
element of the set, since there
are infinitely many it would
never normalize.

\ssection{Why}

Instead, we assign probability
to subsets of the set.
In other words, we associate
a measure with the set.
The measure is normalized, meaning
that the measure of the whole set,
the event corresponding
to any outcome occuring is 1.


A \ct{probability density}{} or
\ct{probability density function}{}
is a real-valued function
from a set of outcomes which is
non-negative and normalized.
A real-valued function on a
an infinite set is  set
is \ct{normalized}{} if the sum over the
its results is 1.
