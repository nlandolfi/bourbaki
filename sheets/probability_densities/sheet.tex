\ssection{Why}

\ssection{Definition}

A \ct{probability density}{}
or \ct{probability density function}{}
is a real-valued function on the reals
which is nonnegative and normalized.
A real-valued function on the reals
is \ct{normalized}{} if it integrates
to 1.

\ssection{Notation}

Let $f: \R \to \R$ with $f \geq 0$
and $\int f = 1$. Then $f$ is a
probability density.
