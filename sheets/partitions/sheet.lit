§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We divide a set into disjoint subsets whose union is the
    whole set. ⦉

  ‖ In this way we can handle each subset of the main set
    individually, and so handle the entire set piece by piece. ⦉
⦉

§ Decomposing a set ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Two sets $A$ and $B$ ❬divide❭ a set $X$ if $A ∪ B = X$
    and $A ∩ B = ∅$. ⦉

  ‖ Although every element is in either $A$ or $B$, no element
    is in both. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ If $𝒜$ is a set of sets, and $A, B ∈ 𝒜$, then $𝒜$ is
    ❬pairwise disjoint❭ if $A ∩ B = ∅$ whenever $A ≠ B$. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬partition❭ (or ❬decomposition❭, ❬set partition❭) of a set $X$ is a set
    of ‹nonempty›, ‹pairwise disjoint›, subsets of $X$ whose union
    is $X$. ⦉

  ‖ We call the elements of a partition the ❬parts❭ (or
    ❬pieces❭, ❬blocks❭, ❬cells❭) of the partition. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ When speaking of a partition, we commonly call the set of
    sets ❬mutually exclusive❭ (or ❬non-overlapping❭), by which we
    mean that they are pairwise disjoint, and ❬collectively
    exhaustive❭, by which we mean that their union is full set.

§§ Other terminology ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Occasionally, the term ❬unlabeled partition❭ is used, and the
    term ‹partition› is reserved for a separate concept. ⦉

  ‖ In this case, the term ❬allocation❭ is sometimes used as an
    abbreviation for unlabeled partition. ⦉
