¶ ⦊
  ‖ \ssection{Why} ⦉

  ‖ We divide a set into disjoint subsets whose union is the
    whole set. ⦉

  ‖ In this way we can handle each subset of the main set
    individually, and so handle the entire set piece by piece. ⦉

  ‖ \ssection{Definition} ⦉

  ‖ A ❬partition❭ of a set $X$ is a set of pairwise disjoint
    (see \sheetref{set_decompositions}{Set Decompositions}) nonempty
    subsets of $X$ whose union is $X$. ⦉

  ‖ We call the elements of a partition the ❬pieces❭ of the
    partition. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ When speaking of a partition, we commonly call the set of
    sets ❬mutually exclusive❭ (by which we mean that they are
    pairwise disjoint) and ❬collectively exhaustive❭ (by which we
    mean that their union is full set). ⦉
