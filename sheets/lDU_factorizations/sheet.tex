\section{Why}

The \t{LDU factorization} of a positive definite matrix is a decomposition of a symmetric permutation of the matrix as a product of a unit lower triangular, a positive diagonal, and a unit upper triangular matrix.

\ssection{Notation}

A LDL decomposition of $A \in \SymPDMat{n}$ is to write
$$
  \IdxMat{\sigma}A\IdxMat{\sigma}^{\tp}
  =
  LDL^{\tp}
$$
where $L$ is unit lower triangular, $D$ is positive diagonal, and $\sigma$ is a permutation of $\upto{n}$.
