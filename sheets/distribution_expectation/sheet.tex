\ssection{Why}

Suppose we are going to make a
bunch of measurements.
We associate to each element of
a finite set a number.
If the measurements we make are
divided into proporitions according
to a distribution,
   if we make all the measurements
   and then average the results
   what do we expect to get.

 \ssection{Definition}

Consider a distribution $p$ and
a real-valued function $f$.
The \ct{distribution expectation}
of $f$ \ct{under}{expectation under}
$p$ is the sum of the product of
the results of $p$ and $f$ on the elements
of the set.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $A$ a finite set.
Let $R$ denote the set of real numbers.
Let $p: A \to R$.
Let $f: A \to R$.
The expectation of $f$ under $p$
is
\[
  \sum_{a \in A} p(a) f(a).
\]
