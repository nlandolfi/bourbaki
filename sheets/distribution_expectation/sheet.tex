\ssection{Why}

Suppose we are going to make a several measurements.
We associate to each element of a finite set a number.
If the measurements we make are divided into proportions according to a distribution, if we make all the measurements and then average the results what do we expect to get.

\ssection{Definition}

Consider a distribution $p$ and a real-valued function $f$.
The \t{distribution expectation} of $f$ \t{under} $p$ is the sum of the product of the results of $p$ and $f$ on the elements of the set.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $A$ a finite set.
Let $p: A \to [0, 1]$ a distribution on a finite set $A$ and let $f: A \to \R $ a function on $A$.
The expectation of $f$ under $p$ is
  \[
\sum_{a \in A} p(a) f(a).
  \]
