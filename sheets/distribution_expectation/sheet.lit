⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose we are going to make a several measurements.
    ‖ We associate to each element of a finite set a number. ⦉

    ‖ If the measurements we make are divided into proportions
      according to a distribution, if we make all the
      measurements and then average the results what do we expect
      to get.

⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Consider a distribution $p$ and a real-valued function $f$. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬distribution expectation❭ of $f$ ❬under❭ $p$ is the sum
    of the product of the results of $p$ and $f$ on the
    elements of the set. ⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A$ a finite set. ⦉

  ‖ Let $p: A → [0, 1]$ a distribution on a finite set $A$
    and let $f: A → 𝗥$ a function on $A$. ⦉

  ‖ The expectation of $f$ under $p$ is
