§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ If we model some measured value as a random variable with
    induced distribution $p: V → 𝗥$, then one interpretation of
    $p(v)$ for $v ∈ V$ is the ‹proportion› of times in a large
    number of trials that we ‹expect› to measure the value $v$. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given a distribution $p: Ω → 𝗥$ and a ‹real-valued› outcome
    variable $x: Ω → 𝗥$, the ❬expectation❭ of $x$ under $p$ is
    $∑_{ω ∈ Ω} p(ω)x(ω)$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the expectation of $x$ under $p$ by $𝗘(x)$. ⦉

  ‖ When there is no chance of ambiguity, we write $𝗘(x)$. ⦉
⦉

§ Properties ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $x, y : Ω → 𝗥$ be two outcome variables and $p: Ω →
    𝗥$ a distribution. ⦉

  ‖ Let $α, β ∈ 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ Define $z = αx + βy$ by $z(ω) = αx(ω) + βy(ω)$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $𝗘(z) = α𝗘(x) + β𝗘(z)$. ⦉
