\section*{Definition}

A \t{hyperplane} in $n$-dimensional space is an $(n-1)$-dimensional affine set.

Since the $n-1$-dimensional subspaces are the orthogonal complements of the one-dimensional subspaces, they are the sets which can be specified by
  \[
\Set*{x \in \R ^n}{x \perp b}
  \]
for $b \in \R ^n$.
The hyperplanes are translates of these,
  \[
\begin{aligned}
\Set*{x \in \R ^n}{x \perp b} + a &= \Set*{x + a}{\ip{x,b} = 0} \\
&= \Set*{y}{\ip{y - a,b} = 0} = \Set*{y}{\ip{y,b} = \beta }, \\
\end{aligned}
  \]
where $\beta  = \ip{a,b}$.

\section*{Characterization}

\begin{prop}
$H \subset \R ^n$ is a hyperplane if and only if there exists $\beta  \in \R $ and nonzero $b \in \R ^n$ so that
$$
H = \Set*{x \in \R ^n}{\ip{x,b} = \beta }.
$$
\end{prop}
\begin{remark}
$b$ and $\beta $ are unique up to a common nonzero multiple.
For example, $b, \beta $ and $2b, 2\beta $ give the same hyperplane.
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
The vector $b$ is called a \t{normal} to the hyperplane.
\end{remark}
