\ssection{Why}

We talk about sequences in
a metric space which are
\say{bunching up.}

\ssection{Definition}

A sequence in a metric space
is \ct{egoprox}{egoprox} if
for every positive real number,
there exists a final
part of the sequence so that
any two terms are less than the
positive number apart.
