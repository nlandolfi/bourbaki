\ssection{Why}

We want to talk about
things which may happen.

\ssection{Concept}

In modeling the future we will partition it
into number of outcomes. The number of outcomes
may be infinite, but it is more often finite.
The outcomes are things of what happen. The idea
is that the future will occur, and then we will
know which one of the many outcomes has taken place.
