§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to describe how fast a function grows or declines.

      ‖ Future editions will expand this vague introduction. ⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $f: 𝗥 → 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬lower growth class❭ of $f$ (❬toward infinity❭) is the
    set of all functions $g: 𝗥 → 𝗥$ for which there exists $C,
    M > 0$ so that $\abs{g(x)} ≤ C\abs{f(x)}$ for all $x > M$. ⦉

  ‖ The intuition is that if $h: 𝗥 → 𝗥$ is in the lower
    growth class of $f$, $h$ does not grow faster than $f$. ⦉

  ‖ In this case we say that $h$ ❬grows at order❭ $f$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬lower limit class of $f$ at $x_0$❭ is the set of all
    functions $g: 𝗥 → 𝗥$ for which there exists $C, ε > 0$ so
    that $\abs{g(x)} ≤ C \abs{f(x)}$ for all $\abs{x - x_0} <
    ε$. ⦉

  ‖ The intuition is that for $x$ sufficiently close to $x_0$,
    the magnitude of $f$ is bounded by a constant times the
    magnitude of $g$. ⦉

  ‖ Often $x_0$ is $0$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬upper growth class❭ of $f$ (❬toward infinity❭) is the
    set of all functions $g: 𝗥 → 𝗥$ for which there exists $C,
    M > 0$ so that $\abs{g(x)} ≥ C\abs{f(x)}$ for all $x > M$. ⦉

  ‖ The intuition is that if $h$ is in the upper growth class
    of $f$, $h$ grows at least as fast as $f$. ⦉

  ‖ We similarly define the ❬upper growth class at a limit
    $x_0$❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬(exact) growth class❭ of $f$ is the set of all
    functions $g: 𝗥 → 𝗥$ for which there exists $C_1, C_2, M$
    so that $C_1\abs{f(x)} ≤ \abs{g(x)} ≤ C_2 \abs{f(x)}$ for all
    $x > M$. ⦉

  ‖ The intuition is that if $h$ is in the growth class of
    $f$, then $h$ and $f$ grow at the same rate. ⦉

  ‖ Again, we similarly define the ❬growth class at limit $x_0$❭. ⦉
⦉

§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the upper, lower and exact growth classes of a
    function $f: 𝗥 → 𝗥$ by of $f$ by $O(f)$, $Ω(f)$ and
    $Θ(f)$, respectively. ⦉

  ‖ We read the notation $O(f)$ as “order at most f,” we read
    $Ω(f)$ as “order at least $f$,” and $Θ(f)$ as “order exactly
    $f$.” ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The letter $O$ is a mnemonic for order, and $Ω$ and $Θ$
    build on this mnemonic. ⦉

  ‖ The term order appears to arise from the use of growth
    classes when discussing Taylor approximations. ⦉

  ‖ In this case of small $x$ (i.e., $\abs{x} < 1$), $\abs{x^p}
    < \abs{x^q}$ if $q < p$ and so higher order terms are
    “smaller” and “negligible.” ⦉

  ‖ This notation is sometimes called ❬Big O notation❭, ❬Landau's
    symbol❭, ❬Landau notation❭ or ❬Landau's notation❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $φ, ψ: 𝗥 → 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ Many authors use $φ = O(ψ)$ or $φ(t) = O(ψ(t))$ to assert
    that $φ$ is in the upper growth class of $ψ$ at some
    understood limit (e.g., $0$ or $∞$). ⦉

  ‖ In other words, the equation asserts that there exists some
    positive constant $C > 0$ sot that, for all $t$ sufficiently
    close to the understood limit, $\abs{φ(t)} ≤ C \abs{ψ(t)}$.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Often also defined $\abs{φ(t)} < Cψ(t)$, with no absolute
        value on $ψ$. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ For example, the statement $\sin^2(t) = P(t^2)$ as $t → 0$
    (or for $t → 0$) means that there exists constants $C, ε >
    0$ so that, $\abs{t} < ε ⟹ \abs{\sin^2(t)} ≤ Ct^2$. ⦉
