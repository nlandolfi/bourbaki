\section*{Why}

We want to consider the elements of one set which are not contained in another set.

\section*{Definition}

Let $A$ and $B$ denote sets.
The \t{difference} between $A$ and $B$ is the set $\Set{x \in A}{x \not\in B}$.
It is not necessary that $B \subset A$.

\subsection*{Notation}

We denote the difference between $A$ and $B$ by $A - B$.

\section*{Properties}

The following are straightforward.\footnote{Accounts will appear in future editions.}

\begin{proposition}
$A - \varnothing = A$\end{proposition}
\begin{proposition}
$A - A = \varnothing$\end{proposition}
