\section*{Why}

We consider elements of one set which are not contained in another set.

\section*{Definition}

Let $A$ and $B$ denote sets.
The \t{difference} between $A$ and $B$ is the set $\Set{x \in A}{x \not\in B}$.
In other words, the difference between $A$ and $B$ is the set of all points of $A$ which do not belong to $B$.

It is not necessary that $B \subset A$; the difference is called \t{proper} if $A \supset B$.
This terminology is from that of \sheetref{set_inclusion}{proper subsets}.

\subsection*{Notation}

We denote the difference between $A$ and $B$ by $A - B$.

\section*{Properties}

The following are straightforward.\footnote{Accounts will appear in future editions.}

\begin{proposition}
$A - \varnothing = A$
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
$A - A = \varnothing$
\end{proposition}
