\s{Why}

We want to consider the elements of one set which are not contained in another set.

\s{Definition}

Let $A$ and $B$ denote sets.
The \t{difference} between $A$ and $B$ is the set $\Set{x \in A}{x \not\in B}$.
It is not necessary that $B \subset A$.

\ss{Notation}

We denote the difference between $A$ and $B$ by $A - B$.

\s{Properties}

The following are straightforward.

\begin{proposition}
  $A - \emptyset = A$
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
  $A - A = \emptyset$
\end{proposition}
