§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to talk about a set with a prescribed quantitative
    degree of closeness (or distance) between its elements. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The correspondences which serve as a degree of closeness, or
    measure of distance, must satisfy our previously developed
    (see␣
    <a href='/sheets/distance.html'>
      ‖ Distance ⦉
    </a>
    ) notion of distance. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A function on ordered pairs which does not depend on the
    order of the elements so considered is ❬symmetric❭. ⦉

  ‖ A function into the real numbers which takes only
    nonnegative values is ❬nonnegative❭. ⦉

  ‖ A repeated pair is an ordered pair of the same element
    twice. ⦉

  ‖ A function which satisfies a triangle inequality for any
    three elements is ❬triangularly transitive❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬metric❭ (or ❬distance function❭) is a function on ordered
    pairs of elements of a set which is symmetric, non-negative,
    zero only on repeated pairs, and triangularly transitive. ⦉

  ‖ A ❬metric space❭ is an ordered pair whose first coordinate
    is a nonempty set and whose second coordinate is a metric. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ In a metric space, we say that one pair of objects is
    ❬closer❭ together if the metric of the first pair is smaller
    than the metric value of the second pair. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Notice that a set can be made into different metric spaces
    by using different metrics. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A$ be a set. ⦉

  ‖ We commonly denote a metric by the letter $d$, as a
    mnemonic for “distance.” ⦉

  ‖ Let $d: A × A → 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $d$ is a metric if:
    𝍫 ⦊
      ‣ it is non-negative, which we tend to denote by
        ◇ ⦊
          ‖ d(a, b) ≥ 0 \quad ∀ a,b ∈ A. ⦉
        ⦉⦉

      ‣ it is $0$ only on repeated pairs, which we tend to
        denote by
        ◇ ⦊
          ‖ d(a, b) = 0 \iff a = b, \quad ∀ a,b ∈ A. ⦉
        ⦉⦉

      ‣ it is symmetric, which we tend to denote by:
        ◇ ⦊
          ‖ d(a, b) = d(b, a), \quad ∀ a,b ∈ A. ⦉
        ⦉⦉

      ‣ it is triangularly transitive, which we tend to denote
        by
        ◇ ⦊
          ‖ d(a, b) ≤ d(a, c) + d(c, b), \quad ∀ a,b,c ∈ A. ⦉
        ⦉⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ As usual, we denote the metric space of $A$ with $d$ by
    $(A, d)$. ⦉

  ‖ Another common choice of letter for a metric is $ρ$. ⦉
⦉

§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ $𝗥$ with the absolute value distance is a metric space. ⦉

  ‖ As is $𝗥^2$ and $𝗥^3$ with the Euclidean distance. ⦉

  ‖ $𝗥^n$ with Euclidean metric is an example of a metric space
    for which the objects ($n$-dimensional tuples of real numbers)
    are impossible to visualize. ⦉
