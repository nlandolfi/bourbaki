\section*{Why}

It is natural to want to define a sequence by giving its first term and then giving its later terms as functions of its earlier ones.
In other words, we want to define sequences inductively.\footnote{Future editions will expand on this. We are really headed toward natural addition, multiplication and exponentiation.}

\begin{proposition}[Recursion theorem]
Let $X$ be a set, let $a \in X$ and let $f: X \to X$.
There exists a unique function $u$ so that $u(0) = a$ and $u(\ssuc{n}) = f(u(n))$.\footnote{The account is somewhat straightforward, given a good understanding of the results of \sheetref{peano_axioms}{Peano Axioms}.
The full account will appear in future editions.}
\end{proposition}

When one uses the recursion theorem to assert the existence of a function with the desired properties, it is called \t{definition by induction}.
