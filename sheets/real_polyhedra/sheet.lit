§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬polyhedron❭ is a set $P ⊂ 𝗥^n$ for which there exists
    $A ∈ 𝗥^{m × n}$ and $b ∈ 𝗥^{m}$ satisfying
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ P = \Set{x ∈ 𝗥^n}{Ax ≤ b}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ In other words, a polyhedron is an intersection of finitely
    many halfpsaces. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A polyhedron $P$ is ❬polytope❭ if it is ‹bounded›.. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, there exists $x_0 ∈ P$ and $M > 0$ such
    that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ P ⊂ B_M(x_0) = \Set{x }{\norm{x - x_0} < M} ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Here $B_M(x_0)$ denotes the open ball of radius $M$, as
    usual. ⦉
