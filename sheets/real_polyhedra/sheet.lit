§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬polyhedron❭ (or ❬real polyhedron❭) is a set $P ⊂ 𝗥^n$
    for which there exists $A ∈ 𝗥^{m × n}$ and $b ∈ 𝗥^{m}$
    satisfying
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ P = \Set{x ∈ 𝗥^n}{Ax ≤ b}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ In other words, a polyhedron is an intersection of finitely
    many halfspaces. ⦉

  ‖ If $A$ and $b$ are rational, then $P$ is called a
    ❬rational polyhedron❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A polyhedron $P$ is a ❬polytope❭ (a ❬real polytope❭) if it
    is ‹bounded›. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, there exists $x_0 ∈ P$ and $M > 0$ such
    that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ P ⊂ B_M(x_0) = \Set{x }{\norm{x - x_0} < M} ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Here $B_M(x_0)$ denotes the open ball of radius $M$, as
    usual. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ As usual, the dimension of a polyhedron $P$ is the
    dimension of the affine hull of $P$, which we denote by
    $\dim P$. ⦉

  ‖ $P$ is called ❬full-dimensional❭ if $\dim P = n$. ⦉

  ‖ An equivalent condition for $P$ to be full-dimensional is
    that there exist an interior point of $P$ (as a subset of
    $𝗥^n$) ⦉
