A \t{polyhedron} is a set $P \subset \R ^n$ for which there exists $A \in \R ^{m \times  n}$ and $b \in \R ^{m}$ satisfying
\[
P = \Set{x \in \R ^n}{Ax \leq b}.
\]
In other words, a polyhedron is an intersection of finitely many halfpsaces.

A polyhedron $P$ is \t{polytope} if it is \textit{bounded}..
In other words, there exists $x_0 \in P$ and $M > 0$ such that
\[
P \subset B_M(x_0) = \Set{x }{\norm{x - x_0} < M}
\]
Here $B_M(x_0)$ denotes the open ball of radius $M$, as usual.
