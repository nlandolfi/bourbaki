§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We return to our discussion of symbols and scripts, to make
    precise these concepts in the language of sets and lists. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ An ❬alphabet❭ is a finite set. ⦉

  ‖ For example, let $A$ be the set
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \set{a, b, c, d, e, f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w, x,
        y,z}, ⦉
    ⦉
    where $a$ denotes the latin lower case letter “a”, $b$
    denotes the latin lower case letter “b”, and so on. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, $A$ is the set of lowercase latin letters. ⦉

  ‖ It is an alphabet. ⦉

  ‖ By analogy with this familiar case, we frequently refer to
    the elements of an alphabet as ❬letters❭ or ❬symbols❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬word❭ is a list of letters in an alphabet, and a
    ❬phrase❭ is a list of words. ⦉

  ‖ For example, $(c,a,t,s)$ is a word in $𝒜$ (meant to
    correspond to the word “cats”) and
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ ((c,a,t,s), (a,n,d), (d,o,g,s)) ⦉
    ⦉

    ‖ is a phrase in $𝒜$ (meant to correspond to the phrase
      “cats and dogs”). ⦉⦉
⦉

§ Strings ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A$ be an alphabet. ⦉

  ‖ In this case (in which $A$ is a finite set), we refer to
    the lists of $A$ as ❬strings❭. ⦉

  ‖ The string whose length is zero is the empty set. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the set of all lists (strings) in $A$ by
    $\str(A)$. ⦉

  ‖ We read $\str(A)$ aloud as “the strings in $A$.” ⦉
