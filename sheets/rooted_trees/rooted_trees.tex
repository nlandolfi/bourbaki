\stitle{Rooted Trees}

\ssection{Why}

We want to talk about orienting the edges of a tree away from a given vertex.

\ssection{Definition}

A \t{rooted tree} is an ordered pair whose first object is a tree and whose second object is a vertex of the tree. We call the vertex the \t{root}.

We associate with a rooted tree the directed graph constructed by orienting al edges away from the root.
For a particular rooted tree, which is to say a particular choice of root, we obtain a directed graph.
There are many choices of root, and so naturally we wonder if each choice of root corresponds to a different directed graph.
Since trees are connected, each choice of root does lead to a different graph.
If they were disconnected, some of the graphs may turn out to be the same.
So there is a one-to-one correspondence between rooted trees and their associated directed graphs, and so we could have defined a rooted tree as a directed graph with particular properties.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(V, T)$ be a tree.
Let $V$ be a non-empty set and $E \subset V \cross V$.
We denote the tree $T = V$ rooted at vertex $i$ by $(T, i)$.

\ssection{Properties}

\begin{prop}
Let $(T, i)$ be a rooted tree.
In the directed graph corresponding to this rooted tree every vertex has one parent.
\end{prop}

We denote the parent of vertex $i$ by $\pa{i}$.
