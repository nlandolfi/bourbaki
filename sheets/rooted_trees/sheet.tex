\ssection{Why}

We want to talk about
orienting the edges of
a tree away from a given
vertex.

\ssection{Definition}

A \emph{rooted tree}
is an ordered pair. The first
object is a tree and the second
object is a vertex of the tree.
We call the
distinctued vertex the \ct{root}{}.

The pair corresponds to a
a directed graph obtained by
orienting all the edges away
from the root.
There are as many choices of
rooted trees as there are choices
of root: namely, the number of
vertices in the tree.
Each choice leads to a different
graph: the tree is, by definition,
connected.
