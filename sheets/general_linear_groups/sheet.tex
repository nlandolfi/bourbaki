\section*{Why}

We can generalize the real general linear groups to vector spaces over $\C  $.

\section*{Definition}

Suppose $V$ is a vector space over the field $\C  $ of complex numbers.
The set of isomorphisms of $V$ onto itself is a group, called the \t{general linear group}, under the operation of composition.
If $V$ has dimension $n$, then the general linear group can be identified with the invertible $n \times  n$ complex matrices in the usual way.

\subsection*{Notation}

We denote by $GL(V)$ the general linear group of isomorphisms of $V$ onto itself.
If $f \in GL(V)$, and $V$ has a finite basis $e_1, \dots  , e_n \in V$, then $f$ has corresponding matrix representation $A \in \C  ^{n \times  n}$ given by
    \[
A = \bmat{ f(e_1) & \cdots & f(e_n)}.
    \]
