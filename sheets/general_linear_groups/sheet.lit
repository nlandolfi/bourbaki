§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We can generalize the real general linear groups to vector
    spaces over $𝗖 $. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $V$ is a vector space over the field $𝗖 $ of
    complex numbers. ⦉

  ‖ The set of isomorphisms of $V$ onto itself is a group,
    called the ❬general linear group❭, under the operation of
    composition. ⦉

  ‖ If $V$ has dimension $n$, then the general linear group can
    be identified with the invertible $n × n$ complex matrices
    in the usual way. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote by $GL(V)$ the general linear group of
    isomorphisms of $V$ onto itself. ⦉

  ‖ If $f ∈ GL(V)$, and $V$ has a finite basis $e_1, … , e_n
    ∈ V$, then $f$ has corresponding matrix representation $A ∈
    𝗖 ^{n × n}$ given by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ A = \bmat{ f(e_1) ＆ ⋯ ＆ f(e_n)}. ⦉
