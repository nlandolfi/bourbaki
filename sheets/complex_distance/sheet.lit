§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The identification of $𝗖$ with a plane leads $𝗖$ to
    naturally inherit $𝗥^2$'s notion of distance. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬absolute value❭ or ❬modulus❭ of $z = (x, y) ∈ 𝗖$ is
    the distance of $z$ to the origin. ⦉

  ‖ If $z ∈ 𝗖$, then the modulus of $z$ is ⦉
  ◇ ⦊
    ‖ √{x^2 + y^2}. ⦉
  ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ In other words, the modulus of $z$ is the distance (in
    $𝗥^2$ of $z = (x,y)$ from the origin $(0,0)$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the modulus of $z$ by $\Cmod{z}$. ⦉
⦉

§ Properties ⦉
<statement type='proposition' text='Triangle Inequality'>
  ‖ For all $z, w ∈ 𝗖$,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \Cabs{z + w} ≤ \Cabs{z} + \Cabs{w}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Also, for all $z ∈ 𝗖$, we have $\Cabs{ℜ(z)} ≤ \Cabs{z}$
    and $\Cabs{ℑ(z)} ≤ \Cabs{z}$, and for all $z, w ∈ 𝗖$,
    † ⦊
      ‖ This follows from the triangle inequality. Future editions
        will include an account. ⦉
    ⦉
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \Cabs{\Cabs{z} - \Cabs{w}} ≤ \Cabs{z - w}. ⦉
