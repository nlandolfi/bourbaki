\section*{Why}

We model a real-valued output as corrupted by small random errors with a normal density.
In other words, we make further distributional assumptions on the probabilistic errors linear model for the purposes of hypothesis testing and interval estimation.\footnote{Future editions will define and need these sheets.}

\section*{Definition}

Let $(x, A, e)$ be a probabilistic errors model and assume $e$ has a normal density with mean $0$ and covariance $\sigma ^2I$.
In this case we call $(x, A, e)$ a \t{classical linear model with normality assumption}.
In this case $y$ is normally distributed with mean $Ax$ and variance $\sigma ^2I$.
