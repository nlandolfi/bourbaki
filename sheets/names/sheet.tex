\ssection{Why}

We (still) want to talk and write about things.

\ssection{Names}

As we use sounds to speak about objects, we use symbols to write about objects.
In these sheets, we will mostly use the upper and lower case latin letters to denote objects.
We sometimes also use an accent $'$ or subscripts or superscripts.
% If we take some symbols like those in \sheetref{letters}{Letters}, and we write them we say that they symbols \t{denote} the object.
When we write the symbol, we say that it \t{denotes} the object.
We call the symbols the \t{name} of the object.
% In these sheets, we will mostly tend to use the upper and lower case latin letters to denote objects.
% Sometimes, however, we will use the Arabic numerals, or add a mark like $'$ to latin letters, or we may use both letters and numerals to denote objects.
% will not always be so.
% For example, we will sometiems use the Arabic numerals.
% Or we may use a letter an accent or several accents after it.

Since we use these same symbols for spoken words of the English language,
% When we are using them in particular as a name for an object, we will put the symbol in italics.
we want to distinguish names from words.
One idea is to box our names, and agree that everything in a box is a name, and that a name always denotes the object.
For example, \fbox{A} or \fbox{A'}.
% Or we could underline our symbols, like \underline{A}.
%  Either would work.
The box works well to group in the accent, and also clarifies that \fbox{A}\fbox{A} is different from \fbox{AA}.
% In the first case, we have denoted the same object \fbox{A} twice whereas in the second we have denoted the object \fbox{AA} once.
But experience shows that the boxes are mostly unnecessary.

We indicate a name for an object with italics.
Instead of \fbox{A'} we use $A'$.
Experience shows that this subtelty is enough for clarity, and it agrees with traditional and modern practice.
% and is several millenia old---so it ought to suit us in these sheets.
% until the next edition.
% Experience shows that using two letters twice is often confusing, and if accents are used, not needed.
% Rather than \fbox{AA} why not use \fbox{A'}.
% Instead of $\fbox{AAA}$, use \fbox{A''}.
% We agree never to use a symbol like \fbox{A'B'}.
% If we have \fbox{A'}\fbox{B'} there is really no confusion in dropping the boxes and writing A'B'.
% But we still want some way of distinguishing that we are talking about objects.


% For historical reasons and reasons of space, we will never use two letters

\s{No repetitions}

We will also agree that we will never use the same name to refer to two different objects.
It is in the nature of things---and of names in particular---that we can not do this without confusion.
% Sometimes we will reuse names, but then it is understood that the we are using the name only in that sheet or that paragraph.
% context will always be scoped to a sheet or to a paragraph.
% There is a historical note that
We tend to introduce names at the beginning of a paragraph or a section.

\s{Names are objects}

There is an odd aspect in these considerations.
$A$ may denote itself, that particular mark on the page.
There is no helping it.
As soon as we use some symbols to identify any object, these symbols can reference themselves.

An interpretation of this peculiarity is that names are objects.
In other words, the name is an abstract object, it is that which we use to refer to another object.
It is the thing pointing to another object.
And the marks on the page which are meant to look similar are the several uses of a name.
%all of which are meant to look similar, which ar meant to denote the object, are uses of the name.
% It has associated with it the several marks on the page, all which look similar, where we have written the name to denote the object.

% So these symbols can reference
% For example, if we want to use the upper case latin letter A as a symbol for an object, we when referencing the object we will write $A$.
% In all cases, we will help to distinguish that the symbols
%
% A second way of distinguishing this may be to box the symbol in question.
% For example, we would denote some object by \fbox{A}.
% or
% \underline{A}.
% It might help to point out another
%
% In all cases, when we use a particular symbol to denote an object, we are mean that the symbol
%
% Whenever we use a particular symbol to denote
%
% \ssection{Assertions}
%
% We use the word \t{assertion} in the usual sense of the English language.
%
% \ssection{Names}
%
% To discuss objects we give them \t{names}.
% For example, \say{the pebble} or \say{the pebble's color}.
% To make statements about objects we use verbs.
% It will turn out that in the sequel we will only use 'is' and 'belongs.'
% All things are stated to hold in the present.
% For example, the pebble is gray.
%
% \ssection{Formal Languages}
%
% We often will say things which are true about objects with particular properties.
% These words do not officially have any meaning yet for us.
% We will write our statements in terms.
% A term will be a placeholder of sorts.
% We will say things like "let $A$ be a term".
% We are interested in deducing belonging relationships a
%
% So we will have some signs.
% An \t{accent} is $'$.
% A \t{letter} is an upper or lower case Latin letter with or without accent.
% The lower case latin letters are
%
%  \t{placeholder} for us will mean any upper or lower case latin letter with or without one or more $'$ marks.
% We will print the placeholder in italics.
% For example, $A$, $A'$, $A''$, $A'''$, $A''''$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$, $F$, $f$, $f'$ are each placeholders.
%
% We will use a formal language to
% Our formal language will consist of \t{terms} and \t{relations}.
% A term is a letter,
% To talk about o
%
% To help our development, we use a formal language.
% The language consists of a few symbols and has enough complexity to let us express English-language sentences like \say{every object in this set is in this other set} and \say{every object in this set has this property} and \say{there exists an object in this set with this property}.

% \end{construction}

% \ssubsection{Names}
%
%
% \say{Variables}
%
% A single Latin letter regularly suffices.
% To aid our memory, we tend to choose the letter mnemonically.
%
% The use of letters to name objects is convenient, since they are short.
% But we must take care when speaking of objects by their names that we know which object is referred to.
%
%
% \ssubsection{Notation}
%
% We use italics when writing the name.
% We introduce a name by the word \say{let,} followed by the name in italics and then the word \say{be} followed by a description of the object the name refers to.
% For example: let $a$ be an object.
% Here the description is \say{an object}.

\s{Placeholders}

We frequently use a name as a \t{placeholder}.
In this case, we will say \say{let $A$ denote an object}.
By this we mean that $A$ is a name for an object, but we do not know what that object is.
This is frequently useful when the arguments we will make do not depend upon the particular object considered.
This practice is also old.
Experience shows it is effective.
As usual, it is beset understood by example.
