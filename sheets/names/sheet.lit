§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We (still) want to talk and write about things. ⦉
⦉

§ Names ⦉
¶ ⦊
  <!-- TODO(next edition) define subscripts and superscripts -->

  ‖ As we use sounds to speak about objects, we use symbols to
    write about objects. ⦉

  ‖ In these sheets, we will mostly use the upper and lower
    case latin letters to denote objects. ⦉

  ‖ We sometimes also use an ❬accent❭ $’$ or subscripts or
    superscripts. ⦉

  ‖ When we write the symbols we say that the composite symbol
    formed ❬denotes❭ the object. ⦉

  ‖ We call it the ❬name❭ of the object. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Since we use these same symbols for spoken words of the
    English language, we want to distinguish names from words. ⦉

  ‖ One idea is to box our names, and agree that everything in
    a box is a name, and that a name always denotes the object. ⦉

  ‖ For example, \fbox{A} or \fbox{A’} or \fbox{A$_0$}. ⦉

  ‖ The box works well to group the symbols and clarifies that
    \fbox{A}\fbox{A} is different from \fbox{AA}. ⦉

  ‖ But experience shows that we need not use boxes. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We indicate a name for an object with italics. ⦉

  ‖ Instead of \fbox{A’} we use $A’$, instead of \fbox{A$_0$} we
    use $A_0$. ⦉

  ‖ Experience shows that this subtlety is enough for clarity
    and it agrees with traditional and modern practice. ⦉

  ‖ Other examples include $A''$, $A''’$, $A''''$, $B$, $C$, $D$,
    $E$, $F$, $f$, $f’$ $f_a$. ⦉
⦉

§ No repetitions ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We never use the same name to refer to two different
    objects. ⦉

  ‖ Using the same name for two different objects causes
    confusion. ⦉

  ‖ We make clear when we reuse symbols to mean different
    objects. ⦉

  ‖ We tend to introduce the names used at the beginning of a
    paragraph or section. ⦉
⦉

§ Names are objects ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ There is an odd aspect in these considerations. ⦉

  ‖ The symbol $A$ may denote itself, that particular mark on
    the page. ⦉

  ‖ There is no helping it. ⦉

  ‖ As soon as we use some symbols to identify any object,
    these symbols can reference themselves. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ An interpretation of this peculiarity is that names are
    objects. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, the name is an abstract object, it is that
    which we use to refer to another object. ⦉

  ‖ It is the thing pointing to another object. ⦉

  ‖ And the marks on the page which are meant to look similar
    are the several uses of a name. ⦉

§ Names as placeholders ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We frequently use a name as a ❬placeholder❭. ⦉

  ‖ In this case, we will say “let $A$ denote an object”. ⦉

  ‖ By this we mean that $A$ is a name for an object, but we
    do not know what that object is. ⦉

  ‖ This is frequently useful when the arguments we will make
    do not depend upon the particular object considered. ⦉

  ‖ This practice is also old. ⦉

  ‖ Experience shows it is effective. ⦉

  ‖ As usual, it is best understood by example. ⦉
