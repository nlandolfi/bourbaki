\ssection{Why}

In the case of several variables, what do the row reducer matrices correspond to in ordinary row reduction?

\ssection{Definition}

Let $(A \in \R^{m \times m}, b \in \R^{m})$ be an ordinarily reducible linear system.
The \t{ordinary reducer sequence} (or \t{ordinary row reducer sequence}) is a sequence of row reducer matrices $L_{1}, \dots L_{m-1}$ so that
\[
  A_1 = L_1A \text{ and } A_i = L_iA_{i-1} \text{ for } 2 \leq i \leq m-1.
\]
In other words, $U \in \R^{m \times m}$ defined by
\[
  U = L_{m-1} \cdots L_2 L_1 A
\]
is the ordinary row reduction of $A$.

\ssubsection{Formulae}

Let $x_1$ be the first column of $A$ and let $x_k$ be the $k$th column of $A_{k-1}$ for $k = 2, \dots, m-1$.
The the transformation $L_k$ is chosen so that
\[
  x_k = \barray{x_{1k} \\ \vdots \\ x_{kk} \\ x_{k+1,k} \\ \vdots \\ x_{mk}} \quad \overset{L_k}{\longrightarrow} \quad L_kx_k = \barray{x_{1k} \\ \vdots \\ x_{kk} \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0}.
\]
we subtract $\ell_{jk} = \nicefrac{x_{jk}}{x_{kk}}$ for $k \leq j \leq m$ times row $k$ from row $j$.
We call $l_{jk}$ the \t{row multiplier}.
The matrix $L_k$ has the form
\[
  L_k = \barray{
    1 & & & &  & \\
    & \ddots & & & & \\
    & & 1 & & & \\
    & & -\ell_{k+1,k} & 1 & &\\
    & & \vdots & & \ddots & & \\
    & & -\ell_{mk} & & & 1
  }
\]

\ssubsection{Properties}

As an immediate consequence of the formula for $L_k$ given above, we have
\begin{proposition}
  Every reducer in an ordinary reducer sequence is unit lower triangular.
\end{proposition}

The goal of row reduction is to introduce zeros below the diagonal so to allow for back-substitution.
The following proposition states that ordinary row reduction succeeds in creating an upper triangular matrix..
\begin{proposition}
  The ordinary row reduction of a matrix is upper triangular.
\end{proposition}
