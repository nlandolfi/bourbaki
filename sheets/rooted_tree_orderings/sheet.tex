\section*{Why}

We want to simplify common questions using orderings of a rooted tree.\footnote{This sheet is incomplete and will be updated in future editions.}

\section*{Definition}

A \t{topological ordering} of a rooted tree is an ordering $\sigma $ for which $v \prec_{\sigma } \pa(v)$.
If there are $n$ vertices, the root has index $n$ and every other vertex has an index less than its parent.

A \t{postordering} is a topological ordering in which descendents of a vertex are given consecutive numbers.
For the postordering $\sigma $, if $\inv{\sigma }(v) = j$ and $v$ has $k$ proper descendents then the proper descendents of $v$ have are numbered consecutively from $j - k$ through $j -1$.
The figure below shows an example.

One can generate a postordering by numbering vertices in decreasing sequence (starting at $n$) in the order they are visited.\footnote{Future editions will clarify.}

Given an ordering, the \t{first descendent} of $v$ (which we denote $\fdesc(v)$) is the descendent with the lowest index.
Given a postordering $\sigma $, one can check whether a vertex $w$ is a proper descendent of $v$, by $\fdesc(v) \preceq_{\sigma } w \prec_{\sigma } v$.
