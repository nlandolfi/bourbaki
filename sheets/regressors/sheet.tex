\section*{Definition}

A \t{regressor} is a predictor whose codomain is the set of real numbers.
Following this terminology, but speaking of processes, some\footnote{Most, nearly all, universally. We do not use this because Bourbaki deals with mathematical objects, for which there is no concept of time.}
authors refer to the problem of constructing a regressor as \t{regression} or a \t{regression problem}.
