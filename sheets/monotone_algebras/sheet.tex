\section*{Why}

Closure under monotone limits is a weaker condition than that included in the definition of sigma algebras, but is sufficient if the set is also an algebra.\footnote{Future editions will expand.}

\section*{Result}

If a subset algebra is a monotone space, then it is a countably summable subset algebra.

\begin{proposition}
A subset algebra is a countably summable if either:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item the limit of a nondecreasing sequence of distinguished sets is distinguished
    \item the limit of a nonincreasing sequence of distinguished sets is distinguished.
  \end{enumerate}\end{proposition}
