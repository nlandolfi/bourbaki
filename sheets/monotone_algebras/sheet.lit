¶ ⦊
  ‖ \ssection{Why} ⦉

  ‖ Closure under monotone limits is a weaker condition than
    that included in the definition of sigma algebras, but is
    sufficient if the set is also an algebra.

¶ ⦊
  ‖ If a subset algebra is a monotone space, then it is a
    countably summable subset algebra. ⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ \begin{prop} ⦉

  ‖ A subset algebra is a countably summable if either:
