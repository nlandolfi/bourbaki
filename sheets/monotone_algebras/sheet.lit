§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Closure under monotone limits is a weaker condition than
    that included in the definition of sigma algebras, but is
    sufficient if the set is also an algebra.

§ Result ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ If a subset algebra is a monotone space, then it is a
    countably summable subset algebra. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ A subset algebra is a countably summable if either:
    𝍫 ⦊
      ‣ the limit of a nondecreasing sequence of distinguished
        sets is distinguished ⦉

      ‣ the limit of a nonincreasing sequence of distinguished
        sets is distinguished. ⦉
