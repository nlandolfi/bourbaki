\ssection{Definition}

An \ct{equation}{equation} is
a statement of equality between
two objects.

For example, if we have an object $a$
and an object $b$, then an equation
is
\[
  a = b.
\]

Equations are useful when we do not
know the particular identity of an
object, but only that it belongs to
some set.
In this case, we call the
equation \ct{indeterminate}{}
