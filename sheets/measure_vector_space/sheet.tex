\section*{Why}

If both signed measures are finite, then their difference is always well-defined.
Is the difference a finite signed measure?

\section*{Preliminary result}

\begin{proposition}
A linear combination of
finite signed measures is
a finite signed measure.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}Let $(X, \mathcal{A} )$ be a measurable space.
Let $\mu $ and $\nu $ be finite signed measures.
Let $R$ denote the real numbers.
Then $(\alpha \mu )(\varnothing) = \alpha  \cdot  \mu (\varnothing) = \alpha  \cdot  0 = 0$.
Also for $\seq{A} \subset \mathcal{A} $ disjoint,
\[
\begin{aligned}
(\alpha \mu )(\cup A_n) &= \alpha  \mu (\cup A_n) = \alpha \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \mu (A_n) \\
&= \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \alpha  \mu (A_n) = (\alpha \mu )(A_n)
\end{aligned}
\]

Similarly, $(\mu  + \nu )(\varnothing) = \mu (\varnothing) + \nu (\varnothing) = 0$.
And, for $\seq{A} \subset \mathcal{A} $ disjoint,
\[
\begin{aligned}
(\mu  + \nu )(\cup A_n) &= \mu (\cup A_n) + \nu (\cup A_n)
= \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \mu (A_n) +
\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \nu (A_n) \\
&= \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \mu (A_n) + \nu (A_n)
= \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} (\mu  + \nu )(A_n)
\end{aligned}
\]
\end{proof}
\section*{Main result}

\begin{proposition}
The set of finite signed measures is a vector space.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}Use the previous proposition.
Observe that the function $\mu  \equiv 0$ is a measure.
And $\nu  + \mu  = \nu $ for all measures $\nu $.\end{proof}
\subsection*{Notation}

We denote the vector space of signed measures on measurable space $(X, \mathcal{A} )$ by by $M(X, \mathcal{A} , \R )$.
