§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ If both signed measures are finite, then their difference is
    always well-defined. ⦉

  ‖ Is the difference a finite signed measure? ⦉
⦉

§ Preliminary result ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ A linear combination of ⦉

  ‖ finite signed measures is ⦉

  ‖ a finite signed measure. ⦉

    ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜)$ be a measurable space. ⦉

    ‖ Let $μ$ and $ν$ be finite signed measures. ⦉

    ‖ Let $R$ denote the real numbers. ⦉

    ‖ Then $(αμ)(∅) = α · μ(∅) = α · 0 = 0$. ⦉

    ‖ Similarly, $(μ + ν)(∅) = μ(∅) + ν(∅) = 0$. ⦉

§ Main result ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ The set of finite signed measures is a vector space. ⦉
</statement>
<proof>
  ‖ Use the previous proposition. ⦉

  ‖ Observe that the function $μ ≡ 0$ is a measure. ⦉

  ‖ And $ν + μ = ν$ for all measures $ν$. ⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the vector space of signed measures on measurable
    space $(X, 𝒜)$ by by $M(X, 𝒜, 𝗥)$. ⦉
