\section*{Why}

It happens that if a distribution factors according to a tree rooted at a particular vertex, it factors according to a tree rooted at any vertex.
So the property of factoring according to a rooted tree is really property of factoring according to a tree.

\section*{Definition}

\subsection*{Defining Result}

\begin{proposition}
Let $A_1, \dots , A_n$ be finite non-empty sets and define $A = \prod_{i = 1}^{n} A_n$.
Let $p: A \to [0, 1]$ be a distribution and let $T$ be a tree on $\set{1, \dots , n}$.\end{proposition}
\begin{proposition}
If a distribution factors according to a tree rooted at a vertex it factors according to that tree rooted at any vertex.\end{proposition}
\subsection*{Undirected definition}

A distribution $p$ \t{factors according to the tree} $T$ if it factors according to the $T$ rooted at any vertex.

\section*{Existence and uniqueness}

Trees are not a property of distributions, since there is no one-to-one correspondence, as demonstrated by the following propositions.

\subsection*{Existence}

A distribution $p$ need not factor according to a tree.

\subsection*{Uniqueness}

A distribution $p$ may factor according to multiple trees.
