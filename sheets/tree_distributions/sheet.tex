\ssection{Why}

It happens that if a distribution factors according to a tree rooted at a particular vertex, it factors according to a tree rooted at any vertex.
So the property of factoring according to a rooted tree is really property of factoring according to a tree.

\ssection{Definition}

\subsection{Defining Result}

\begin{prop}

Let $A_1, \dots, A_n$ be finite non-empty sets and define $A = \prod_{i = 1}^{n} A_n$.
Let $p: A \to [0, 1]$ be a distribution and let $T$ be a tree on $\set{1, \dots, n}$.

\end{prop}

\begin{prop}

If a distribution factors according to a tree rooted at a vertex it factors according to that tree rooted at any vertex.

\end{prop}

\ssubsection{Undirected Definition}

A distribution $p$
\t{factors according to the tree}{} $T$
if it factors according to the
$T$ rooted at any vertex.

\ssection{Existence and Uniqueness}

Trees are not a property of distributions,
since there is no one-to-one correspondence,
as demonstrated by the following propositions.

\ssubsection{Existence}

A distribution $p$ need not factor according to a tree.

\ssubsection{Uniqueness}
A distribution
$p$ may factor according to multiple trees.
