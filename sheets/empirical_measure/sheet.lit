§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ There is a natural probability measure on a measurable space
    to associate with a dataset from the base set of that space. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬empirical measure❭ for a dataset in some measurable
    space is the measure which associates to each event the
    proportion of the records which are elements of that event. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(a^1, …, a^n)$ be a dataset in a measurable space
    $(A, 𝒜)$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $P: \powerset{A} → [0, 1]$ be the probability measure
    that assigns to each set $B ⊂ A$ the number
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ P(B) = \frac{1}{n} \num{\Set{k ∈ \set{1, …, n}}{a^k ∈
        B}}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Then $P$ is the empirical measure. ⦉
