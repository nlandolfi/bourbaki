\ssection{Why}

There is a natural probability measure on a measurable space to associate with a dataset from the base set of that space.

\ssection{Definition}

The \t{empirical measure} for a dataset in some measurable space is the measure which associates to each event the proportion of the records which are elements of that event.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(a^1, \dots, a^n)$ be a dataset in a measurable space $(A, \CA)$.
Let $P: \powerset{A} \to [0, 1]$ be the probability measure that assigns to each set $B \subset A$ the number
$$
  P(B) = \frac{1}{n} \card{\Set*{k \in \set{1, \dots, n}}{a^k \in B}}.
$$
Then $P$ is the empirical measure.
