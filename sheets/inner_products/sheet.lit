§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We abstract the notion of inner product to an arbitrary
    vector space. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $𝗙$ is a field which is either $𝗥$ or $𝗖$. Let
    $(V, 𝗙)$ be a vector space. ⦉

  ‖ Then a function $f: V × V → 𝗙$ is an ❬inner product❭ on
    $V$ if
    𝍫 ⦊
      ‣ ‖ $f(x, x) ≥ 0$, $f(x, x) = 0 \Leftrightarrow x = 0$; ⦉⦉

      ‣ ‖ $f(x, y) = \overline{f(y, x)}$ ⦉⦉

      ‣ ‖ $f(ax + by, z) = a(x, z) + b(y, z)$ ⦉⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ A ❬inner product space❭ (or ❬pre-Hilbert space❭) is a tuple
    ($V, f)$ where $V$ is an inner product space over $𝗙$ and
    $f: V^2 → 𝗙$ is an inner product. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ If $$ is a vector space over the field $𝗙$ we regularly
    denote an inner product for $V$ by $\ip{·,·}: V^2 → 𝗙$. ⦉

  ‖ So we would denote the inner product of the vector $x$
    with the vector $y$ by $\ip{x, y}$. ⦉
