¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝗥)$ be a vector space. ⦉

  ‖ A function $f: X × X → 𝗥$ is an ❬inner product❭ on the
    vector space $(X, 𝗥)$ if
    𝍫 ⦊
      ‣ $f(x,x) ≥ 0$, $= 0 \iff x = 0$, ⦉

      ‣ $f(x+y,z) = f(x,z) + f(y, z)$, ⦉

      ‣ $f(x,y) = f(y,x)$, and ⦉

      ‣ $f(α x,y) = α f(x,y)$. ⦉

  ‖ An ❬inner product space❭ is an ordered pair: a real vector
    space and an inner product.

¶ ⦊
  ‖ $𝗥^n$ with the usual inner product is an inner product
    space. ⦉

  ‖ Some authors call any finite-dimensional inner product space
    over the real numbers is a ❬Euclidean vector space❭. ⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ If $f: X × X → 𝗥$ is an inner product we regularly
    denote $f(x, x)$ by $\ip{x,x}$. ⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Two vectors in an inner product space are ❬orthogonal❭ if
    their inner product is zero. ⦉

  ‖ An ❬orthogonal family of vectors❭ in an inner product space
    is a family of vectors for which distinct family members are
    orthogonal. ⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A vector is ❬normalized❭ if its inner product with itself
    is one. ⦉
