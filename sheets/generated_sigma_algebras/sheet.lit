§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A simple (albeit indirect) way to obtain a sigma algebra,
    is to start with some sets, and then to add all the sets
    needed to make the starting set closed under the various
    operations. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬generated sigma algebra❭ for a set of subsets is the
    smallest sigma algbera containing the set of subsets. ⦉

  ‖ We must prove the existence and uniqueness of this sigma
    algebra. ⦉
⦉

<statement id='intersectsigmalgebras' type='proposition'>
  ‖ The intersection of a non-empty set of sigma algebras over
    the same set is a sigma algebra. ⦉
</statement>
<proof>
  ‖ Given a family of sigma algebras $\set{(A, 𝒜_α}_{α ∈ I}$
    over some set, define $𝒜 = ∩_{α ∈ I} 𝒜_α$.
    𝍫 ⦊
      ‣ ‖ For all $α ∈ I$, $A ∈ 𝒜_{α}$, thus $A ∈ 𝒜$; condition (a). ⦉⦉

      ‣ ‖ For all $B ∈ 𝒜$, for all $α ∈ I$, $B ∈ 𝒜_{α}$. ⦉

        ‖ Thus, for all $α ∈ I$, $C_{A}(B) ∈ 𝒜_{α}$. ⦉

        ‖ And so $C_{A}(B) ∈ 𝒜$; condition (b). ⦉⦉

      ‣ ‖ For all sequences $\set{B_n} ⊂ 𝒜$, $\set{B_n} ⊂ 𝒜_{α}$ for
          all $α$. ⦉

        ‖ Thus $∪_{n} B_n ∈ 𝒜_{α}$ for all $α$ and so $∪_{n}
          B_n ∈ 𝒜$; condition (c). ⦉⦉
    ⦉⦉
</proof>
¶ ⦊
  ‖ On the other hand, the union of a set of sigma algebras
    can fail to be a sigma algebra. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ If $A$ is a set and $𝒜 ⊂ 2^A$, then there is a unique a
    smallest sigma algebra containing $𝒜$. ⦉
</statement>
<proof>
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ We know of one sigma algebra containing $𝒜$: the power
      set of $A$. ⦉

    ‖ Thus, the set of sigma algebras containing $𝒜$ is not
      empty. ⦉

    ‖ Proposition~\ref{intersectsigmaalgebras} implies the
      intersection of all such sigma algebras (containing $𝒜$) is
      a sigma algebra. ⦉

    ‖ The intersection contains $𝒜$, and is contained in all
      other sigma algebras with this property, so is a smallest
      sigma algebra containing $𝒜$. ⦉

    ‖ If $ℬ, 𝒞$ were two smallest sigma algebras, then $ℬ ⊂ 𝒞$
      and $𝒞 ⊂ ℬ$, but then $ℬ = 𝒞$; thus the smallest sigma
      algebra is unique. ⦉
  ⦉
</proof>

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A$ be a set and $𝒜 ⊂ \powerset{A}$. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the sigma algebra generated by $𝒜$ by $σ(𝒜)$. ⦉
