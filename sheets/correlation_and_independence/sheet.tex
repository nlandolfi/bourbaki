\section*{Why}

How does correlation relate to independence?

\section*{Results}

These two properties are not equivalent: independence is stronger than uncorrelated.

\begin{proposition}
Two integrable and independent real-valued random variables are uncorrelated.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
There exist uncorrelated integrable real-valued random variables which are not independent.
\end{proposition}
