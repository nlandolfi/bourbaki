\stitle{Correlation and Independence}

\ssection{Why}

How does correlation relate
to independence?

\ssection{Results}

These two properties
are not equivalent:
independence is stronger
than uncorrelated.

\begin{prop}
Two integrable and independent
real-valued random variables
are uncorrelated.
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}
There exist uncorrelated
integrable real-valued random variables
which are not independent.
\end{prop}
