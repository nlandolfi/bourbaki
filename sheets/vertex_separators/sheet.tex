\ssection{Definition}

A \t{vertex separator} for two vertices of an undirected graph is a subset of the vertices of the graph is the vertices are in different connected components of the subgraph induced by the complement of the subset of vertices.
A vertex separator is a \t{minimal vertex separator} for two vertices if no proper subset of it is a vertex separator for those vertices.
Other names for minimal vertex separators are \t{relatively minimal cutsets}.


\ssection{Result}

\begin{prop}

  A graph is chordal if and only if all minimal vertex separators are complete.
