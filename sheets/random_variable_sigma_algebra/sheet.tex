\ssection{Definition}
\ssubsection{Defining Result}

\begin{prop}

The set of inverse images
the distinguished sets
of a measurable space under
a function from a set to
that space is a sigma algebra.

If the first set and the
function are measurable,
the sigma algebra is a sub
sigma algebra of the domain
sigma algebra.

\begin{proof}
  Let $(X, \SA)$
  and $(Y, \SB)$ be
  measurable spaces.
  Let $f: X \to Y$
  be a measurable function.
  Define
  \[
    \SC := \Set*{f^{-1}(B)}{B \in \SB}.
  \]

  First,
  since $f^{-1}(Y) = X$,
  $X \in \SC$.

  Second, let $C \in \SC$.
  Then there is $B$ such that
  $C = f^{-1}(B)$.
  Then $X - C = X - f^{-1}(B) = f^{-1}(Y - B)$.
  Since $\SB$ is a sigma algebra,
  $B \in \SB, Y - B \in \SB$ and so
  $X - C \in \SC$.

  Finally, let $\seq{C} \subset \SC$.
  Then for every $n$ there exists
  a $B_n \in \SB$ so that $C_n = f^{-1}(B_n)$.
  Then:
  \[
    \union_{n} C_n = \union_n f^{-1}(B_n) = f^{-1}(\union B_n).
  \]
  Since $\SB$ is a sigma algebra,
  $\union_n B_n \in \SB$ and so $\union_{n} C_n \in \SC$.

  Since $f$ is measurable,
  $f^{-1}(B) \in \SA$ for
  every $B \in \SB$, and so $\SC \subset \SA$.
\end{proof}
\end{prop}

The sigma algebra
\ct{generated by a random variable}{}
is the sigma algebra consisting
of the inverse images of every measurable
set of the codomain.

The sigma algebra generated
by a family of random variables
is the sigma algebra generated
by the union of the sigma algebras
generated individually by each
of the random variables.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(X, \SA, \mu)$ be a probability
space and $(Y, \SB)$ be a measurable
space.
Let $f: X \to Y$ be a random variable.
Denote by $\sigma(f)$ the
sigma algebra generated by $f$.

\ssection{Results}

\begin{prop}
  The sigma algebra generated
  by a family of random variables
  is the smallest sigma algebra
  for with respect to which each
  random variable is measurably.
\end{prop}
