§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We can approximate a density with a tree density similar to
    how we can approximate a distribution with a tree
    distribution. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We use the differential relative entropy as a criterion of
    approximation. ⦉

  ‖ An ❬optimal tree approximator❭ of density for a tree is a
    density which factors according to a tree and minimizes its
    differential relative entropy with the given density. ⦉
⦉

§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $g: 𝗥^n → 𝗥$ be a density and $T$ be a tree on
    $\set{1, …, n}$. ⦉

  ‖ An optimal tree approximator of $g$ for $T$ is a density
    $f$ that factors according to $T$ and minimizes $d(g, f)$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, given $g$ and $T$ we want to find $f$ to
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \begin{aligned} ⦉

      ‖ \text{minimize} ＆\quad d(g, f) ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ \text{subject to} ＆\quad f \text{ factors according to }
        T. ⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Let $g: 𝗥^n → 𝗥$ be a density and $T$ be a tree on
      $\set{1, …, n}$. ⦉

    ‖ The density $f^*_T: 𝗥^d → 𝗥$ defined by ⦉

    ‖ $$ ⦉

    ‖ f^*_T = g_1 ∏_{i ≠ 1} g_{i |\pa{i}} ⦉

    ‖ $$ ⦉

    ‖ minimizes the differential relative entropy with $g$ among
      all densities on $𝗥^n$ which factor according to $T$
      ($\pa{i}$ is the parent of $i$ in $T$ rooted at vertex
      $1$, $i = 2, …, n$). ⦉

<proof>
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Let $f: 𝗥^d → 𝗥$ be a density factoring according to $T$. ⦉

    ‖ First, express
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ f = f_1 ∏_{i = 1} f_{i |\pa{i}}. ⦉
      ⦉⦉
  ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Second, recall that $d(g, f) = h(g, f) - h(g)$. ⦉

    ‖ Since $h(g)$ does not depend on $f$, $f$ is a minimizer
      of $d(g, f)$ if and only if $f$ is a minimizer of $h(g,
      f)$. ⦉
  ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Third, express
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ \begin{aligned} ⦉

        ‖ h(g, f) &= - ∈t_{𝗥^d} g \log f ᜶ ⦉

        ‖ &= - ∈t_{𝗥^d} g(x) \parens*{ \log f_{i}(x_i) + ∑_{i ≠
          1} \log f_{i |\pa{i}}(x_i, x_{\pa{i}})} dx ᜶ ⦉

        ‖ &= h(g_1, f_1) + ∑_{i ≠ 1} \parens*{ ∈t_{𝗥}
          g_{\pa{i}}(ξ) h\parens*{g_{i |\pa{i}}(·, ξ),
          f_{i\mid\pa{i}}(·,ξ)}dξ} ⦉

        ‖ \end{aligned} ⦉
      ⦉
      which separates across $f_1$ and $f_{i |\pa{i}}(·, ξ)$ for
      $i = 1, …, n$ and $ξ ∈ 𝗥$. ⦉

    ‖ In particular, since $g_{pa{i}} ≥ 0$, we can minimize the
      integrand pointwise. ⦉
  ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Fourth, recall $h(φ, ψ) ≥ 0$ for densities $φ, ψ$ of any
      dimension, and zero if $φ = ψ$. ⦉

    ‖ So $f_1 = g_1$ and $f_{i |\pa{i}} = g_{i |\pa{i}}$ are
      solutions. ⦉
