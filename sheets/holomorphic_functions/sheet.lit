§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $Ω ⊂ 𝗖$ is open and $f: Ω → 𝗖$. ⦉

  ‖ Given $z_0 ∈ 𝗖$, we say that $f$ is ❬holomorphic at❭ (or
    ❬complex differentiable at❭) $z_0$ if the complex quotient
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \frac{f(z_0 + h) - f(z_0)}{h} ⦉
    ⦉
    has a limit when $h → ∞$. ⦉

  ‖ Here $h ∈ 𝗖$, $h ≠ 0$ and $z_0 + h ∈ Ω$ so that the
    quotient is well-defined. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ This condition is the complex analogue of a real function
    being ‹differentiable› at a point. ⦉

  ‖ The difference, of course, is that here $h$ is complex, and
    so the condition above encomposes all limits approaching $z$
    (all angles) in the complex plane.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will clarify. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ In other words, $h$ is a complex number approaching the
    complex number $(0, 0)$ from any direction. ⦉

  ‖ If the limit exists, then we call it the ❬derivative of
    $f$ at $z_0$❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The function $f$ is ❬holomorphic❭ (❬regular❭, ❬complex
    differentiable❭) on $Ω$ if $f$ is holomorphic at every point
    of $Ω$. ⦉

  ‖ If $C$ is a closed subset of $𝗖$, we say that $f$ is
    holomorphic on $C$ if $f$ is holomorphic on some open set
    containing $c$. ⦉

  ‖ If $f$ is holomorphic on all of $𝗖$ then we call $f$
    ❬entire❭. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ In the case that $f: Ω → 𝗖$ is holomorphic at $z_0$ we
    denote the derivative at $z_0$ by $f’(z_0)$. ⦉

  ‖ By definition,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ f’(z_0) = \lim_{h → 0} \frac{f(z_0 + h) - f(z_0)}{h} ⦉
    ⦉
    where the right hand side is assumed to exist. ⦉
