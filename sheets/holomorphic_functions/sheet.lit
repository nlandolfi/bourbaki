§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $Ω$ be an open set in $𝗖$ and let $f: Ω → 𝗖$. ⦉

  ‖ The function $f$ is ❬holomorphic at the point❭ $z_0 ∈ 𝗖$
    if the complex quotient
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \frac{f(z_0 + h) - f(z_0)}{h} ⦉
    ⦉
    has a limit when $h → ∞$, where $h ∈ 𝗖$, $h \not= 0$
    and $z_0 + h ∈ Ω$ so that the quotient is well-defined. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ This condition is similar to saying that a function is
    differentiable, except that the $h$ is complex and so the
    condition above encomposes all limits approaching $z$ (all
    angles) in the complex plane.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will clarify. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ But we emphasize that $h$ is a complex number approaching
    the complex number $(0, 0)$ from any direction. ⦉

  ‖ If the limit exists, then we call its value the ❬derivative
    of $f$ at $z_0$❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The function $f$ is ❬holomorphic❭ on $Ω$ if $f$ is
    holomorphic at every point of $Ω$. ⦉

  ‖ If $C$ is a closed subset of $𝗖$, we say that $f$ is
    holomorphic on $C$ if $f$ is holomorphic on some open set
    containing $c$. ⦉

  ‖ If $f$ is holomorphic on all of $C$ then we call $f$
    ❬entire❭. ⦉

  ‖ A holomorphic function is sometimes called ❬regular❭ or
    ❬complex differentiable❭. ⦉

  ‖ The latter term is used in view of the similarities with
    the definition of a real derivative. ⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ In the case that $f: Ω → 𝗖$ is holomorphic at $z_0$ we
    denote the derivative at $z_0$ by $f’(z_0)$. ⦉

  ‖ We have defined $f’(z_0)$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ f’(z_0) = \lim_{h → 0} \frac{f(z_0 + h) - f(z_0)}{h}. ⦉
