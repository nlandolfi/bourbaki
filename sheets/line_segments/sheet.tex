\section*{Definition}

Given points $x$ and $y$ in a real vector space $V$, the closed line segment between $x$ and $y$ is the set $[x, y]$ defined by
\[
[x,y] = \Set*{x + \alpha (y-x)}{0 \leq \alpha  \leq 1}
\]
Notice that $x + \alpha (y - x) = (1-\alpha )x + \alpha y$.
Similarly, we denote the open line segment by $(x, y)$.
