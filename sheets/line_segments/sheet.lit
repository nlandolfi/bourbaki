§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given points $x$ and $y$ in a real vector space $V$, the
    closed line segment between $x$ and $y$ is the set $[x, y]$
    defined by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ [x,y] = \Set*{x + α(y-x)}{0 ≤ α ≤ 1} ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Notice that $x + α(y - x) = (1-α)x + αy$. ⦉

  ‖ Similarly, we denote the open line segment by $(x, y)$. ⦉
