§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Which matrices have orthogonal eigenvectors? ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬normal matrix❭ is a matrix which has orthogonal
    eigenvectors. ⦉

  ‖ It commutes with its (conjugate) transpose. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ If $A ∈ 𝗖^{d ×d}$ is normal then there exists an
    orthonormal matrix $Q ∈ 𝗖^{d ×d}$ and a diagonal matrix $Λ∈
    𝗖^{d ×d}$ so that $A = QΛQ^⊤$. ⦉
