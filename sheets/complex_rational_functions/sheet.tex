\ssection{Definition}

A \t{complex rational function} (or \t{rational function}, or \t{fractional function}) in $\C$ is a function $f: \C \to \C$ for which there exists
polynomials $p: \C \to \C$ and $q: \C \to \C$ in $\C$ so that
\[
    f(z) = \frac{p(z)}{q(z)},
\]
for all $z \in \C$.
In other words, a rational function is a \say{quotient} (see \sheetref{complex_products}{Complex Products}) of two polynomials in $\C$.
