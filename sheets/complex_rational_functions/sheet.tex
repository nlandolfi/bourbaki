\section*{Definition}

A \t{complex rational function} (or \t{rational function}, or \t{fractional function}) in $\C $ is a function $f: \C  \to \C $ for which there exists polynomials $p: \C  \to \C $ and $q: \C \to \C $ in $\C $ so that
\[
f(z) = \frac{p(z)}{q(z)},
\]
for all $z \in \C $.
In other words, a rational function is a ``quotient'' (see \sheetref{complex_products}{Complex Products}) of two polynomials in $\C $.
