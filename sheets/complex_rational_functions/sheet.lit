§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬complex rational function❭ (or ❬rational function❭, or
    ❬fractional function❭) in $𝗖$ is a function $f: 𝗖 → 𝗖$ for
    which there exists polynomials $p: 𝗖 → 𝗖$ and $q: 𝗖 → 𝗖$
    in $𝗖$ so that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ f(z) = \frac{p(z)}{q(z)}, ⦉
    ⦉
    for all $z ∈ 𝗖$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, a rational function is a “quotient” (see ␣
    <a href='/sheets/complex_products.html'>
      ‖ Complex Products ⦉
    </a>
    ) of two polynomials in $𝗖$. ⦉
