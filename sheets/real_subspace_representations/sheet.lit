§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ How should we represent a subspace computationally? ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given a subspace $S ∈ 𝗥^n$, since it is finite dimensional,
    there exists a finite basis for the space. ⦉

  ‖ This basis can be made orthonormal. ⦉

  ‖ Therefore every subspace $S$ has an orthonormal basis $q_1,
    …, q_k$, where $k$ is the dimension of the subspace. ⦉

  ‖ We can stack these as a matrix. Define $Q ∈ 𝗥^{n × k}$
    by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ Q = \bmat{q_1 ❲&❳ q_2 ❲&❳ ⋯ ❲&❳ q_k}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ For every $x ∈ S$, there exists unique coefficients $z ∈
    𝗥^k$ so that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ x = Qz. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Therefore we have a one-to-one correspondence between vectors
    $x ∈ S$ and their coordinates $z ∈ 𝗥^k$. ⦉
