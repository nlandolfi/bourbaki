§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ For general measure theory, we need an algebra of sets
    closed under countable unions; we define such an object.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will make no reference to measure theory.
        The entire development will follow the genetic approach,
        and so roughly follow the historical development for
        handling integration. ⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬countably summable subset algebra❭ is a subset algebra
    for which (1) the base set is distinguished (2) the
    complement of a distinguished set is distinguished (3) the
    union of a sequence of distinguished sets is distinguished. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The name is justified, as each countably summable subset
    algebra is a subset algebra, because the union of $A_1, …,
    A_n$ coincides with the union of $A_1, ⋯, A_n, A_n, A_n ⋯$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We call the set of distinguished sets a ❬sigma algebra❭ (or
    ❬sigma field❭) ❬on❭ the base set. ⦉

  ‖ This language is justified (as for a regular subset algebra)
    by the closure properties of the sigma algebra under the
    usual set operations. ⦉

  ‖ We sometimes write are $σ$-algebra and $σ$-field. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬sub-$σ$-algebra❭ (❬sub-sigma-algebra❭) is a subset of a
    sigma algebra which is itself a sigma algebra. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  <!-- The notation follows that of a subset space. -->

  ‖ Let $(A, 𝒜)$ be a countably summable subset algebra. ⦉

  ‖ We often say “let $𝒜$ be a sigma algebra on $A$.” ⦉

  ‖ Since the largest element of the sigma algebra is the base
    set, we can also say (without ambiguity): “let $𝒜$ be a
    sigma algebra.” ⦉

  ‖ In this last case, the base set is $∪ 𝒜$. ⦉
