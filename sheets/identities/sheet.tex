\ssection{Why}

We can give the same object two different names.

\ssection{Definition}

An object \t{is} itself.
If the object denoted by one name is the same as the object denoted by a second name, then we say that the two names are \t{equal}.
The object associated with a \t{name} is the \t{identity} of the name.

Let $A$ denote an object and let $B$ denote an object.
Here we are using $A$ and $B$ as placeholders.
They are names for objects, but we do not know---or care---which objects.
We say \say{$A$ equals $B$} as a shorthand for \say{the object denoted by $A$ is the same as the object denoted by $B$}.
In other words, $A$ and $B$ are two names for the same object.

\ssection{Symmetry}

\say{$A$ equals $B$} means the same as \say{$B$ equals $A$}.
This is because the identity of the object is not changed by the order in which the names are given.

This fact is called the \t{symmetry of identity}.
It is obvious.
Not subtle in the slightest.
We can switch the spots of $A$ and $B$ and say the same thing.
There are two ways to say the same thing.
% If we switch the spots of $A$ and $B$.
% What it means
% \say{the object denoted by $A$ is the same as the object denoted by $B$} and \say{the object denoted by $B$ is the same as the object denoted by $A$}.


\s{Reflexivity}

Let $A$ denote an object.
Since every object is the same as itself, the object denoted by $A$ is the same as the object denoted by $A$.
We say \say{$A$ equals $A$}.
In other words, every name equals itself.

This fact is called the \t{reflexivity of identity}.
It too is obvious.
And not subtle.
We can always declare that the same symbol denotes the same object.
We agreed upon this in \sheetref{names}{Names}.

% \ssubsection{Notation}
%
% Denote an object by $a$ and another object $b$.
% We denote that the object $a$ is $b$ by $a = b$.
% We denote that the object named $a$ and the object named $b$ refer to the same object by $a = b$.
% We read this notation aloud as: \say{a equals b} or \say{the object denoted by a is the same as object denoted by b}.
% We denote that the object $a$ and $b$ refer to different objects by $a \neq b$.
% We read this aloud as \say{the object denoted by a is not the object denoted by b} or \say{a does not equal b}.
%
% %We may also read the notation
% %$a = b$ aloud as \say{a
% %equals b}.
% Other English readings of $a = b$ include: \say{a is the same as b},
% \say{a is equivalent to b}, \say{a refers to the same object as b.}
%
% \ssubsection{Properties}
%
% Given an object $a$, $a = a$ is true.
% We say that equivalence is \t{reflexive}.
% Given objects $a$ and $b$, $a = b$ implues $b = a$.
% We say that equality is \t{symmetric}.
% Given objects $a$, $b$, and $c$, $a = b$ and $b = c$ implies $a = c$.
% We say that equality is \t{transitive}.
