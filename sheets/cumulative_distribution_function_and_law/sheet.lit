§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ If two random variables have the same cumulative distribution
    functions, will they have the same law? ⦉

  ‖ And what of the converse? ⦉
⦉

§ Result ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ The cumulative distribution functions of two random variables
    are equal if and only if their laws are equal. ⦉
