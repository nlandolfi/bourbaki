\stitle{Cumulative Distribution Function and Law}

\ssection{Why}

If two random variables
have the same cumulative
distribution functions,
will they have the same
law? And the converse?
NEED: probability space
construction from cumulative
distribution function.

\ssection{Result}

\begin{prop}
  The cumulative distribution
  functions of two random
  variables are equal if
  and only if their laws are
  equal.
  \begin{proof}
  \end{proof}
\end{prop}
