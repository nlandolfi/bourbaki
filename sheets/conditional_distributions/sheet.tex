\ssection{Why}
  \ifhmode\unskip\fi\footnote{

  }
We want to speak of the pairwise conditional distributions of a particular joint distribution.

\ssection{Definition}
Let $p: \prod_{i = 1}^{n} A_i \to \R $ be a distribution on $A$.

For $i \neq j \in \set{1, \dots, n}$, the \t{conditional distribution} of $i$ on $j$ is the function $p_{i \mid j}: A_i \times A_j \to \R $ defined so that that $p_{i \mid j}(\cdot, b)$ is the conditional distribution induced by conditioning on $\Set{a \in \prod_{i = 1}^{n} A_i }{a_j = b}$.

For $i,j = 1, \dots, n$ and $i \neq j$, $p_i$ and $p_{i,j}$ satisify
  \[
p_{i \mid j}(b, c)p_{j}(c) = p_{ij}(b, c)
  \]
for $b \in A_i$ and $c \in A_j$.
