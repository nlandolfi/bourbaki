\ssection{Definition}

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $R$ denote the set of
real numbers.
Let $A_1, \dots, A_n$ be
a sequence of non-empty finite
sets.
Let $A = \prod_{i = 1}^{n} A_i$
Let $p: A \to R$ be a distribution
on $A$.
We denote the conditional
distribution of $i$ on $j$ of
$p$ by $p_{i \mid j}: A_i \times A_j \to R$
For $i,j = 1, \dots, n$ and $i \neq j$
$p_i$ satisifes
\[
  p_{i \mid j}(b, c)p_{j}(c) = p_{ij}(b, c)
\]
for every $b \in A_i$ and $c \in A_j$.
