§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The integrable functions are a vector space. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬interable function space❭ corresponding to a measure
    space is the set of real-valued functions which are
    integrable with respect to the measure. ⦉

  ‖ The term space is appropriate because this set is a real
    vector space. ⦉

  ‖ If we scale an integrable function, it remains integrable. ⦉

  ‖ If we add two integrable functions, the sum is integrable. ⦉

  ‖ Thus, a linear combination of integrable functions is
    integrable. ⦉

  ‖ The zero function is the zero element of the vector space. ⦉
⦉

<!-- TODO -->
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The open question is: what elements of our geometric
    intuition can we bring to a space of functions. ⦉

  ‖ Do functions have a size? ⦉

  ‖ Are certain functions near each other? ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ be a measure space. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote set the real-valued integrable functions on $X$ by
    $ℐ(X, 𝒜, μ, 𝗥)$, read aloud as “the real integrable
    functions on the measure space X script A mu.” ⦉

  ‖ We denote set the complex-valued integrable functions on $X$
    by $ℐ(X, 𝒜, μ, 𝗖)$, read aloud as “the complex integrable
    functions on the measure space X script A mu.” ⦉

  ‖ When the field is irrelevant, we denote them by $ℐ(X, 𝒜,
    μ)$, read aloud as “integrable functions on the measure space
    X script A mu.” ⦉

  ‖ The $ℐ$ is a mnemonic for “integrable.” ⦉
