\stitle{Random Variables Joint Law}

\ssection{Why}

We name the image
measure of a collection of
real-valued random
variables.

\ssection{Definition}

The \ct{joint law}{}
of an
ordered finite family
of $n$ real-valued
random variables
is the image measure
of the tuple-valued
function whose components
are the individual
random variables.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $R$ denote
the set of real numbers
and let $R^n$
denote set of
$n$-tuples of real numbers.
Let $f_1, \dots, f_n$
be random variables
defined on a probability
space $(X, \SA, \mu)$.
Define $f: X \to R^n$
by $(f(x))_i = f_i(x)$.
The joint law is the image
measure of $f$.

We denote the joint
law of $\set{f_i}$
by $\rvlaw{\mu}{f_1, \dots, f_n}:
\SA \to \nneri$.
We defined it by
\[
  \rvlaw{\mu}{f_1, \dots, f_n}(A)
  = \mu(\Set*{x \in X}{f(x) \in A}).
\]
for all $A$ in the topological
sigma algebra on $R^n$.
