§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We name the image measure of a collection of real-valued
    random variables. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬joint law❭ of a sequence of $n$ real-valued random
    variables is the image measure of the tuple-valued function
    whose components are the individual random variables. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ be a probability space and $(Y, ℬ)$ be a
    measurable space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $f_1, …, f_n: X → Y$ be random variables. ⦉

  ‖ Define $f: X → Y^n$ by $(f(x))_i = f_i(x)$. ⦉

  ‖ The joint law is the image measure of $f$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the joint law of $\set{f_i}$ by $\rvlaw{μ}{f_1, …,
    f_n}: 𝒜 → \nneri$. ⦉

  ‖ We defined it by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \rvlaw{μ}{f_1, …, f_n}(A) ⦉

      ‖ = μ(\Set*{x ∈ X}{f(x) ∈ A}). ⦉
    ⦉
    for all $A$ in the product sigma algebra on $Y^n$. ⦉
