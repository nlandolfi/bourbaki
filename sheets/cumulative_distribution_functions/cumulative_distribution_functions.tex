\stitle{Cumulative Distribution Functions}

\ssection{Why}

TODO


\ssection{Definition}

The
\ct{cumulative distribution function}{}
of a real-valued random variable is the
function mapping real numbers to the
measure of the set of outcomes for which
the random variable takes value less
than or equal to that real number.
The range of the
cumulative distribution function
is the interval $[0, 1]$, since the
measure of the base set is one
and all measures are non-negative.



\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(X, \SA, \mu)$
be a probability space.
Let $R$ denote the real
numbers.
Let $f: X \to R$ be
a measurable function,
and so a real-valued random
variable.
We denote the cumulative
distribution function
of $f$ by $\rvcdf{f}: R \to [0, 1]$.
We defined it by
\[
  \rvcdf{f}(t) = \mu(\Set*{x \in X}{f(x) \leq t}).
\]

\ssection{Properties}

\begin{prop}
The cumulative distribution function
of any real-valued random variable
\begin{enumerate}

  \item
    is non-decreasing,

  \item
    is right-continuous,

  \item
    tends to one as its argument
    tends toward infinity, and

  \item
    tends to zero as its argument
    tends towards negative infinity.
\end{enumerate}
