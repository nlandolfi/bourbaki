\ssection{Definition}

The \t{cumulative distribution function} of a real-valued random variable is the function mapping a real number to the measure of the set of outcomes for which the random variable takes value less than or equal to the number.
Notation (below) helps.

The range of the cumulative distribution function is the interval $[0, 1]$, since the measure of the base set is one and all measures are non-negative.

We often abbreviate the words \say{cumulative distribution function} by \t{c.d.f.} or \t{cdf}.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(X, \SA, \mu)$ be a probability space.
Let $f: X \to \R$ be a measurable function (a real-valued random variable).
We denote the cumulative distribution function of $f$ by $\rvcdf{f}: \R \to [0, 1]$.
We defined it by
\[
  \rvcdf{f}(t) = \mu(\Set*{x \in X}{f(x) \leq t}).
\]

\ssection{Properties}

\begin{prop}
The cumulative distribution function
of any real-valued random variable
\begin{enumerate}

  \item
    is non-decreasing,

  \item
    is right-continuous,

  \item
    tends to one as its argument
    tends toward infinity, and

  \item
    tends to zero as its argument
    tends towards negative infinity.
\end{enumerate}
