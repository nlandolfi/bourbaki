\section*{Definition}

The \t{cumulative distribution function} of a real-valued random variable is the function mapping a real number to the measure of the set of outcomes for which the random variable takes value less than or equal to the number.
Notation (below) helps.

The range of the cumulative distribution function is the interval $[0, 1]$, since the measure of the base set is one and all measures are non-negative.

We often abbreviate the words ``cumulative distribution function'' by \t{c.d.f.} or \t{cdf}.

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $(X, \mathcal{A} , \mu )$ be a probability space.
Let $f: X \to \R $ be a measurable function (a real-valued random variable).
We denote the cumulative distribution function of $f$ by $\rvcdf{f}: \R  \to [0, 1]$.
We defined it by
\[
\rvcdf{f}(t) = \mu (\Set*{x \in X}{f(x) \leq t}).
\]

\section*{Properties}

\begin{proposition}
The cumulative distribution function of any real-valued random variable
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item is non-decreasing,
    \item is right-continuous,
    \item tends to one as its argument tends toward infinity, and
    \item tends to zero as its argument tends towards negative infinity.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
