§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬cumulative distribution function❭ of a real-valued random
    variable is the function mapping a real number to the
    measure of the set of outcomes for which the random variable
    takes value less than or equal to the number. ⦉

  ‖ Notation (below) helps. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The range of the cumulative distribution function is the
    interval $[0, 1]$, since the measure of the base set is one
    and all measures are non-negative. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We often abbreviate the words “cumulative distribution
    function” by ❬c.d.f.❭ or ❬cdf❭. ⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ be a probability space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $f: X → 𝗥$ be a measurable function (a real-valued
    random variable). ⦉

  ‖ We denote the cumulative distribution function of $f$ by
    $\rvcdf{f}: 𝗥 → [0, 1]$. ⦉

  ‖ We defined it by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \rvcdf{f}(t) = μ(\Set*{x ∈ X}{f(x) ≤ t}). ⦉
