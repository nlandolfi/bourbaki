§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to define area under a real function. ⦉

  ‖ We begin with functions whose area under the curve is
    self-evident. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Consider a measure space. ⦉

  ‖ The characteristic function of any measurable set is
    measurable. ⦉

  ‖ A simple function is measurable if and only if each element
    of its simple partition is measurable. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬integral❭ of a measurable non-negative simple function
    is the sum of the products of the measure of each piece
    with the value of the function on that piece. ⦉

  ‖ For example, the integral of a measurable characteristic
    function of a subset is the measure of that subset. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬integral operator❭ is the real-valued function which
    associates each measurable non-negative simple function with
    its integral. ⦉

  ‖ The simple integral is non-negative, so the integral operator
    is a non-negative function. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ be a measure space. ⦉
⦉

<!--
%Let $A \in \mathcal{A}$.
%We denote the integral
%of $\chi_{A}$ with
%respect to measure $\mu$ by
%$\int \chi_{A} d \mu$.
%We defined:
%\[
%  \int \chi_{A} = \mu(A).

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $f: X → 𝗥$ be a measurable simple function. ⦉

  ‖ So there exist $A_1, …, A_n ∈ 𝒜$ and $a_1, …, a_n ∈ 𝗥$
    with:
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ f = ∑_{i = 1}^{n} a_i χ_{A_i}. ⦉

⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the integral of $f$ with respect to measure $μ$
    by $∫ f dμ$. ⦉

  ‖ We defined:
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ ∫ f dμ = ∑_{i = 1}^{n} a_i μ(A_i). ⦉
