§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to define area under a real function. ⦉

  ‖ We begin with functions whose area under the curve is
    self-evident. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Consider a measure space. ⦉

  ‖ The characteristic function of any measurable set is
    measurable. ⦉

  ‖ A simple function is measurable if and only if each element
    of its simple partition is measurable. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬integral❭ of a measurable non-negative simple function
    is the sum of the products of the measure of each piece
    with the value of the function on that piece. ⦉

  ‖ For example, the integral of a measurable characteristic
    function of a subset is the measure of that subset. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬integral operator❭ is the real-valued function which
    associates each measurable non-negative simple function with
    its integral. ⦉

  ‖ The simple integral is non-negative, so the integral operator
    is a non-negative function. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉

<!--
Let $A \in \mathcal{A}$.
We denote the integral
of $\chi_{A}$ with
respect to measure $\mu$ by
$\int \chi_{A} d \mu$.
We defined:
\[
  \int \chi_{A} = \mu(A).
\]

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ is a measure space and $f: X → 𝗥$ is
    a measurable simple function; i.e., there are $A_1, …, A_n ∈
    𝒜$ and $a_1, …, a_n ∈ 𝗥$ with:
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ f = ∑_{i = 1}^{n} a_i χ_{A_i}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the integral of $f$ with respect to measure $μ$
    by $∫ f dμ$, which we defined as
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ ∫ f dμ := ∑_{i = 1}^{n} a_i μ(A_i). ⦉
