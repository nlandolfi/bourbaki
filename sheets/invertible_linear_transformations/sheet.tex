\begin{proposition}
Suppose $T: V \to W$ is linear and $T^{-1}$ exists.
Then $T^{-1}$ is linear.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}We show that $T^{-1}$ is additive and homogenous.
Let $w_1, w_2 \in W$ and define $v_1$ and $v_2$ so that
\[
v_1 = T^{-1}(w_1) \quad \text{ and } \quad v_2 = T^{-1}(w_2)
\]
In other words,
\[
Tv_1 = w_1 \quad \text{ and } \quad Tv_2 = w_2
\]
and so by the linearity of $T$,\end{proof}
Recall that we can use the terminology \textit{the} inverse because inverses are unique (if they exist; see \sheetref{function_inverses}{Function Inverses}).
\section*{Definition}

A linear map $T \in \mathcal{L} (V, W)$ is \t{invertible} if there is a linear map $S \in \mathcal{L} (W, v)$ so that $ST$
