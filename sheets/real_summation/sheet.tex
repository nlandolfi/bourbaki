\section*{Why}

We want a notation for expressing the sum of a sequence of real numbers.

\section*{Definition}

Let $x = (x_1, \dots , x_n)$ be a sequence of real numbers.
The \t{sequence sum} of $x$ is the result of first summing the first two numbers, then summing the result with the third number, and so on, until we have summed all the numbers.

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $x = (x_1, \dots , x_n)$ be a sequence of real numbers.
We denote the sequence sum of $x$ by
\[
\sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i
\]

\subsection*{Summing over finite sets}

Suppose $A$ is a finite set and $f: A \to \R $ is a function.
Then we the notation
\[
\sum_{a \in A} f(a)
\]
is notation for $\sum_{i = 1}^{n} f(\sigma (i))$ where $\sigma : \set{1, \dots , \num{A}} \to A$ is any numbering of $A$.
The numbering is inconsequential because addition is commutative.
