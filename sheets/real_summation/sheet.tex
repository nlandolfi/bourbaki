\section*{Why}

We want a notation for expressing the sum of a sequence of real numbers.

\section*{Definition}

Let $x = (x_1, \dots , x_n)$ be a sequence of real numbers.
The \t{sequence sum} of $x$ is the result of first summing the first two numbers, then summing the result with the third number, and so on, until we have summed all the numbers.

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $x = (x_1, \dots , x_n)$ be a sequence of real numbers.
We denote the sequence sum of $x$ by
    \[
\sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i
    \]
