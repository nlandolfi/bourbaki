§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want a notation for expressing the sum of a sequence of
    real numbers. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $x = (x_1, …, x_n)$ be a sequence of real numbers. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬sequence sum❭ of $x$ is the result of first summing
    the first two numbers, then summing the result with the
    third number, and so on, until we have summed all the
    numbers. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $x = (x_1, …, x_n)$ be a sequence of real numbers. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the sequence sum of $x$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ ∑_{i = 1}^{n} x_i ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

§§ Summing over finite sets ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $A$ is a finite set and $f: A → 𝗥$ is a function. ⦉

  ‖ Then we the notation
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ ∑_{a ∈ A} f(a) ⦉
    ⦉
    is notation for $∑_{i = 1}^{n} f(σ(i))$ where $σ: \set{1,
    …, \num{A}} → A$ is any numbering of $A$. ⦉

  ‖ The numbering is inconsequential because addition is
    commutative. ⦉
