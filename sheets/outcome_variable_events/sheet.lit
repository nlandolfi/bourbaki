§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ For each value of a random variable’s codomain, the set of
    outcomes corresponding to that value is the inverse image of
    the random variable. ⦉

  ‖ We can speak of the probability that a random variable
    takes a value then, by assigning it the probability of the
    set of outcomes corresponding to that value. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $p: Ω → 𝗥$ be a probability distribution with
    corresponding probability measure $𝗣: \powerset{Ω} → 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ Suppose $x: Ω → V$ is an outcome variable. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬probability $x = a$❭, for $a ∈ Ω$, is
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \textstyle ⦉

      ‖ 𝗣(\Set{ω ∈ Ω}{x(ω) = a}). ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ From the definition of $𝗣$, we express the above as
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \textstyle ⦉

      ‖ ∑_{ω ∈ Ω | x(ω) = a} p(ω). ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ We refer to the probability of the ‹event› that $x = a$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the probability that $x = a$ by $𝗣[x = a]$. ⦉

  ‖ Our square brackets deviate from the slightly slippery but
    universally standard notation $𝗣(x = a)$. ⦉

  ‖ We prefer the square brackets, since $x=a$ is not itself an
    argument to $𝗣$, but shorthand for the set $\Set{ω ∈ Ω}{x(ω)
    = a}$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ There are many similar notations. ⦉

  ‖ For example, $𝗣[x ∈ C]$ means $𝗣(\Set{x ∈ Ω}{x(ω) ∈ C})$. ⦉

  ‖ In particular, if $x: Ω → 𝗥$, $𝗣[x ≥ a]$ means $𝗣(\Set{ω
    ∈ Ω}{x(ω) ≥ a})$. ⦉

  ‖ Since the ‹event› that $x = a$ is the inverse image of
    $\set{a}$ under $x$, we also use the notations $𝗣(x^{-1}(a))$
    and $𝗣(x^{-1}(C))$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Example: sum of two dice ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Define $Ω = \set{1, …, 6}^2$ and define $p: Ω → 𝗥$ with
    $p(ω) = 1/36$ for each $ω ∈ Ω$. ⦉

  ‖ Define $x: Ω → 𝗡$ by $x(ω_1, ω_2) = ω_1 + ω_2$. ⦉

  ‖ Then
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ 𝗣[x = 4] = p((2, 2)) + p(1, 3) + p(3, 1) = 1/12. ⦉
