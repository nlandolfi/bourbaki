§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A ∈ 𝗥^{l × m}$ and $B ∈ 𝗥^{m × n}$. ⦉

  ‖ In this case we call $A$ and $B$ ❬conformable❭. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬matrix-matrix product❭ of $A$ and $B$ is the matrix $C
    ∈ 𝗥^{l × n}$ whose $i$th row $c_i$ (for $i = 1, …, n$)
    is defind $c_i = Ab_i$ where $b_i$ is the $i$th row of $B$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the matrix product of $A$ and $B$ by $AB$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Properties ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Future editions will contain accounts of the following basic
    properties. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Matrix multiplication is associative. ⦉
</statement>
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Matrix multiplication is not commutative. ⦉
</statement>
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Indeed, the matrix-matrix product of $B$ and $A$ may not
    even be defined, if $B$ and $A$ are not conformable. ⦉
⦉

§§ Identity matrix ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The matrix which is the identity under the operation of
    multiplication is the one which has ones on its diagonals
    and zero elswhere.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will improve and expand. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ We denote the $d × d$ identity matrix by $I_d$, or, when
    no confusion is possible by $I$. ⦉
