\ssection{Definition}

The \t{sum} of two sets in a vector space is the set of points which can be expressed as the sum one vector from the first set and one vector from the second set.

Sometimes called \t{Minkowski sum} (true?).

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(V, \F)$ be a vector space and let $M_1, M_2 \subset V$.
Then the sum of $M_1$ and $M_2$ is
$$
  \Set*{x_1 + x_2}{x_1 \in M_1, x_2 \in M_2},
$$
which we denote by $M_1 + M_2$.
