\section*{Definition}

Suppose $V$ is a vector space over $\R $ and $A \subset V$.
Then $a \in A$ is an \t{extreme point} of $A$ if there does not exist not exist $b, c \in V$, $b \neq c$ with $a \in [b, c]$.
% show that this is equivalent to Barvinok's definition 


\subsection*{Notation}

We denote the extreme points of $A$ by $\ex(A)$.
