¶ ⦊
  ‖ We are regularly thinking of $𝗖$ as plane. ⦉

⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Since $𝗖 = 𝗥^2$, we can identify elements of $𝗖$ with
    points in the plane (as we did in \sheetref{real_plane}{Real
    Plane}). ⦉

  ‖ In this case, if $z = x + iy ∈ 𝗖$ (i.e, $z = (x, y) ∈
    𝗥^2$), we can visualize this identification in the following
    figure. ⦉

⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We can identify the origin with the complex number $(0,0) =
    0 ∈ 𝗖$. ⦉

  ‖ For this reason we call $0 ∈ 𝗖$ the ❬complex origin❭. ⦉

  ‖ Likewise, the imaginary number $(0, 1) = i ∈ 𝗖$ corresponds
    to $(0,1)$ ⦉

  ‖ Clearly, the horizontal axis corresponds to the purely real
    numbers and the vertical axis corresponds to the purely
    imaginary numbers. ⦉

  ‖ For these reasons, we refer to these axes as the ❬real
    axis❭ and ❬imaginary axis❭, respectively. ⦉

  ‖ We refer to Figure~\ref{complex_plane:figure:complex_plane} as
    the ❬complex plane❭ (or ❬Argand diagram❭). ⦉
