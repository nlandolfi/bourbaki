§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We regularly visualize $𝗖$ as a plane. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Since $𝗖 = 𝗥^2$, we can identify elements of $𝗖$ with
    points in the plane (as we did in␣
    <a href='/sheets/real_plane.html'>
      ‖ Real Plane ⦉
    </a>
    ). ⦉

  ‖ In this case, if $z = x + iy ∈ 𝗖$ (i.e, $z = (x, y) ∈
    𝗥^2$), we can visualize this identification in the following
    figure. ⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We identify the origin with the complex number $(0, 0) = 0
    ∈ 𝗖$ and for this reason call $0 ∈ 𝗖$ the ❬complex origin❭. ⦉

  ‖ Likewise, the imaginary number $(0, 1) = i ∈ 𝗖$ corresponds
    to $(0,1)$ ⦉

  ‖ The horizontal axis corresponds to the purely real numbers
    and the vertical axis corresponds to the purely imaginary
    numbers. ⦉

  ‖ For these reasons, we refer to these axes as the ❬real
    axis❭ and ❬imaginary axis❭, respectively. ⦉

  ‖ We refer to the above figure as the ❬complex plane❭ (or
    ❬Argand diagram❭). ⦉
