\section*{Definition}

The \t{tail sigma algebra} of a sequence of random variables is the sigma algebra which is the intersection of the sigma algebras of all final parts of the sequence.
A \t{tail event} is an element of the tail sigma-algebra.

The tail sigma algebra coincides with the sigma algebra generated by the union of the sigma algebras of each of of the random variables.

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $\seq{f}$ be a sequence of random variables.
Denote the tail sigma algebra by $T(\seq{f})$.
We defined it as:
\[
T(\seq{f}) = \bigcap_{n = 1}^{\infty} \sigma (\set{X_{n+k}}_k).
\]
In other words, for all natural $n$, the event is in the sigma algebra of the final part of ...

\section*{Results}

\begin{proposition}
The tail sigma algebra of a sequence of random variables is the same equals the sigma algebra generated by the union of the sigma algebras of each of the random variables.
\end{proposition}
