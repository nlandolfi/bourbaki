§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We can consider function composition for linear maps? ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given vector spaces $U, V, W$ over the same field $𝗙$ and
    linear maps $T ∈ ℒ(U, V)$ and $S ∈ ℒ(V, W)$, the ❬product❭
    of $S$ and $T$ is the linear map $R ∈ ℒ(U, W)$ defined by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ R(u) = S(T(u)) \quad \text{for all } u ∈ U ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ (Prove that $R$ so defined is linear). ⦉

  ‖ In other words, the product is $S ∘ T$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ This definition only makes sense if $T$ maps into the
    domain of $S$. ⦉

  ‖ We often say that the maps are ❬conforming❭ in this case. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Often the product is denoted $ST$ (instead of $S ∘ T$). ⦉
⦉

§ Algebraic properties ⦉
<statement type='proposition' text='associativity'>
  ‖ Suppose $T_1, T_2, T_3$ are three linear maps so that
    conforming for $T_1T_2T_3$. ⦉

  ‖ Then
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ (T_1T_2)T_3 = T_1(T_2T_3) ⦉
    ⦉⦉
</statement>

§§ Not commutative ⦉

§ Image of zero ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Suppose $T$ is a linear map from $V$ to $W$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $T(0) = 0$. ⦉
