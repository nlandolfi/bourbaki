§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A subset of $𝗥^n$ is ❬affine❭ (or an ❬affine variety❭,
    ❬linear variety❭, or ❬flat❭) if it contains the lines through
    each of its points. ⦉

  ‖ Our definition is meant to capture the intuitive idea of an
    infinite, uncurved set, like a line or a plane in space. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Some authors use the term ❬affine subspace❭, but we avoid
    this terminology because affine sets are not subspaces. ⦉

  ‖ In fact, they are translated subspaces. ⦉
⦉

§§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The empty set is trivially an affine set. ⦉

  ‖ The entire set of points in $n$-dimensional space is an
    affine set. ⦉

  ‖ Any singleton is an affine set. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ As usual, let $L(x, y)$ denote the line between $x, y ∈
    𝗥^n$. ⦉

  ‖ The set $M ⊂ 𝗥^n$ is affine if $L(a, b) ⊂ M$ for all
    $a, b ∈ M$. ⦉

  ‖ For any $x, y ∈ M$ and $λ ∈ 𝗥$,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ (1-λ)x + λy ∈ M. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

§ Translations ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The set of affine sets is closed under translation. ⦉
  <statement type='proposition'>
    ‖ Let $M ⊂ 𝗥^n$ affine. ⦉

    ‖ Then $M + a$ is affine for any $a ∈ 𝗥$. ⦉
    <proof>
      ‖ Suppose $x, y ∈ M+a$. ⦉

      ‖ There exist $\tilde{x}, \tilde{y} ∈ M$ with $x =
        \tilde{x} + a$ and $y = \tilde{y} + a$. ⦉

      ‖ For any $λ ∈ 𝗥$,
        ◇ ⦊
          ‖ \begin{aligned} ⦉

          ‖ (1-λ)x + λy ＆ = (1-λ)(\tilde{x} + a) + λ(\tilde{y}
            + a) ᜶ ⦉

          ‖ ＆= ((1-λ)\tilde{x} + λ\tilde{y}) + a. ⦉

          ‖ \end{aligned} ⦉
        ⦉⦉
    </proof>
  </statement>
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ An affine set $M$ is ❬parallel❭ to an affine set $L$ if
    there exists $a ∈ 𝗥^n$ so that $M = L + a$. ⦉

  ‖ The relation “$M$ is parallel to $L$” on the set of affine
    sets is an equivalence relation. ⦉

  ‖ This notion of parallelism is more restrictive than the
    natural one, in which we may speak of a line being parallel
    to a plane. ⦉

  ‖ We must speak of a line which is parallel to another line
    within the given plane. ⦉
⦉

§ Properties ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The set of affine sets is closed under intersection. ⦉
  <statement type='proposition'>
    ‖ If $ℳ$ is a family of affine sets, then $⋂ℳ$ is affine. ⦉
  </statement>
