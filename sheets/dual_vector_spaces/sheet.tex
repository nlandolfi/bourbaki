\section*{Definition}

The \t{dual vector space} (or \t{dual space}, \t{algebraic dual space}) of a vector space $V$ over a field $\F $ is the space $\mathcal{L} (V, \F )$.
In other words, the dual space is the set of linear functionals on $V$.

\subsection*{Notation}

There are many notations in use. We will use $V'$.
Another common notation is $V^*$ (however we reserve this notation for adjoints, to come).
