§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬dual vector space❭ (or ❬dual space❭, ❬algebraic dual
    space❭) of a vector space $V$ over a field $𝗙$ is the
    space $ℒ(V, 𝗙)$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, the dual space is the set of linear
    functionals on $V$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ There are many notations in use. We will use $V'$. ⦉

  ‖ Another common notation is $V^*$ (however we reserve this
    notation for adjoints, to come). ⦉
