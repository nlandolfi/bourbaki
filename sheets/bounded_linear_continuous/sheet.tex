\ssection{Why}

All continuous functions
between norm spaces are
bounded linear functions.

\ssection{Result}

\begin{prop}
Let $((V_1, F), \norm{\cdot}_1)$
and
Let $((V_2, F), \norm{\cdot}_2)$
be two norm spaces.
Let $f: V_1 \to V_2$ be a linear
function between two
norm spaces. Then
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    $\exists x \in V_1$ such that $f$ is
    continuous at $x$,

  \item
    $f$ is continuous,

  \item
    $f$ is uniformly continuous, and

  \item
    $f$ is bounded,
\end{enumerate}
are all equivalent conditions.
\end{prop}
