§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ All continuous functions between norm spaces are bounded
    linear functions. ⦉
⦉

§ Result ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Let $((V_1, F), \norm{·}_1)$ and $((V_2, F), \norm{·}_2)$ be
    two norm spaces. ⦉

  ‖ Let $f: V_1 → V_2$ be a linear function between two norm
    spaces. ⦉

  ‖ Then
    𝍫 ⦊
      ‣ $∃x ∈ V_1$ such that $f$ is continuous at $x$, ⦉

      ‣ $f$ is continuous, ⦉

      ‣ $f$ is uniformly continuous, and ⦉

      ‣ $f$ is bounded, ⦉
    ⦉
    are all equivalent conditions. ⦉
