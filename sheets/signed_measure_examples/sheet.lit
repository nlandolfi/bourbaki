§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let us consider examples of signed measures. ⦉
⦉

§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Consider an integrable ⦉

  ‖ function defined on ⦉

  ‖ some measurable space. ⦉

  ‖ The extended-real-valued ⦉

  ‖ funciton which assigns to ⦉

  ‖ each distinguished set the ⦉

  ‖ value of the integrating ⦉

  ‖ the function over that set ⦉

  ‖ is a signed measure. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='example'>
  ‖ Suppose $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ a measure space and $f: X → 𝗥$ is an
    integrable function. ⦉

  ‖ Define $ν: 𝒜 → R$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ ν(A) = ∈t_{A} f dμ. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Then $ν$ is a signed measure. ⦉
  <!--
  <proof>
    ‖ First, ⦉
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ ν(∅) = ∈t fχ_{∅} dμ = ∈t 0 dμ = 0. ⦉
    ⦉

    ‖ Next, let $\seq{A}$ disjoint. ⦉

    ‖ Notice that, ⦉
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ χ_{∪_{i = 1}^{n} A_k} = ∑_{i = k}^{n} χ_{A_k} ⦉
