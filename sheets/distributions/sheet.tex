\ssection{Why}

We want to talk about
probability over finite
sets.

\ssection{Definition}

A \ct{distribution}{distribution}
is real-valued function on a finite
set with two properties. First, the result
of the distribution on each element of the
set is nonnegative.
Second, the sum of the results of all
elements of the set sum to one.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $A$ be a finite set.
Let $R$ be the real numbers.
Let $p: A \to R$.

$p$ is a distribution if
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $p(a) \geq 0$ for every $a \in A$
  \item $\sum_{a \in A} p(a) = 1$
\end{enumerate}
