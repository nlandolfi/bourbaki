\ssection{Why}

We can generalize random variables and random vectors.

\ssection{Definition}
Let $(\Omega, \CA, \PM)$ a probability space and $I$ an index set.
A \t{random function} (or \t{random process}, or \t{stochastic process}\footnote{The word \say{process} is often used when the index set is associated with time}) on $I$ is a family of random variables with a common codomain.

Let $A$ be the codomain of the random variables.
Then we say that the random functionj is on $I$ and in $A$.
We say that the random function is $A$-valued.
