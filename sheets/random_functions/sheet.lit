§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We generalize random variables and random vectors to a map
    from the outcome space to a space of functions. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬random function❭ is a map from the set of outcomes of
    a probability space to a set of functions.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will make measurability precise. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(Ω, 𝒜, 𝗣)$ be a probability space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $A$ and $B$ be sets and let $x: Ω → (A → B)$ be a
    random function. ⦉

  ‖ For each outcome $ω ∈ Ω$, $x_{ω}: A → B$ is a function
    from $A$ to $B$. ⦉
⦉

§ A family of random variables ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬stochastic process❭ (or ❬random process❭ or ❬random
    field❭) is a family of random variables. ⦉

  ‖ The term process is often used when the index set is
    associated with time and the term field is often used when
    the index set is associated with space. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We can associate to the random function $x: Ω → (A → B)$
    a family of random variables $y: A → (Ω → B)$ defined by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ y(a)(ω) = x(ω)(a). ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ The index set of the family is the domain of the set of
    functions. ⦉

  ‖ The codomain of each random variable is the codomain of the
    set of functions. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The converse is also naturally true. ⦉

  ‖ Any family of random variables can be associated with a
    random function. ⦉

  ‖ In this way, a random function corresponds to a family of
    random variables, and any family of random variables
    corresponds to a random function. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ For this reason many authors use the term random function
    or stochastic function and random process or stochastic
    process interchangeably. ⦉

  ‖ In these sheets, we will be specific. ⦉
⦉

Notice that our definition of random function has required nothing about the measurability of the map.
