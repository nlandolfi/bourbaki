\stitle{Simple Functions}

\ssection{Why}

We want to define
area under a real
function.
We define functions
for which this notion
is clear.

\ssection{Definition}

A
\ct{simple function}{simplefunction}
is a function whose range is a finite
set.

Partition the range into
the finite family of
one-element sets
The family whose
members consist of
the inverse images of
these sets is
a partition of
the domain.
We call this the
\ct{simple partition}{simplepartition}
of the function.

A
\ct{real simple function}{realsimplefunctions}
is a simple function whose codomain is real.
In this case, we can write the simple
function as a sum of the characteristic
functions of the inverse images elements.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $A$ and $B$ be non-empty
sets.
We denote the set of
simple functions
from $A$ to $B$
by $\smplfns{A}{B}$.

We
denote the
set of simple real
functions with domain
$A$ by
by $\rsmplfns{A}$.
We
denote subset of
non-negative simple
real functions
with domain $A$ by
by $\nnsmplfns{A}$.

Let
$f \in \smplfns{A}$.
Order the members
of the range of $f$
from $1$ to $n$ as
$r_1, \dots, r_n$.
Define $A_i = f^{-1}(\set{r_i})$.
Then
$f = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} r_i \chi_{A_i}$.
