\section*{Definition}

The \t{variance} of a square-integrable real-valued random variable is the expectation of its square less its expectation squared.

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $(X, \SA, \mu )$
be a probability space
and $f$ be a random variable.
We denote the variance
of $f$ by $\var f$.
We defined it by
  \[
\var f = \E (f^2) - (\E (f))^2.
  \]

\section*{Results}

\begin{prop}
If a random
variable on a probability
space is square integrable
then it is integrable.
\begin{proof}
The $L^p$ spaces are nested
for finite measures.
\end{proof}
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}
The variance of a square-integrable real-valued random variable is the expectation of the square of the difference between the random variable and its expectation.
\end{prop}
