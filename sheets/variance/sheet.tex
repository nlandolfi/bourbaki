\section*{Definition}

The \t{variance} of a square-integrable real-valued random variable is the expectation of its square less its expectation squared.

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $(X, \mathcal{A} , \mu )$
be a probability space
and $f$ be a random variable.
We denote the variance
of $f$ by $\var f$.
We defined it by
\[
\var f = \E (f^2) - (\E (f))^2.
\]

\section*{Results}

\begin{proposition}
If a random variable on a probability space is square integrable then it is integrable.
\begin{proof}The $L^p$ spaces are nested
for finite measures.\end{proof}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
The variance of a square-integrable real-valued random variable is the expectation of the square of the difference between the random variable and its expectation.
\end{proposition}
