§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬variance❭ of a square-integrable real-valued random
    variable is the expectation of its square less its
    expectation squared. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉


¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, \SA, μ)$ ⦉

  ‖ be a probability space ⦉

  ‖ and $f$ be a random variable. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the variance ⦉

  ‖ of $f$ by $\var f$. ⦉

  ‖ We defined it by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \var f = 𝗘(f^2) - (𝗘(f))^2. ⦉

§ Results ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ \begin{prop} ⦉

  ‖ If a random ⦉

  ‖ variable on a probability ⦉

  ‖ space is square integrable ⦉

  ‖ then it is integrable. ⦉

  ‖ \begin{proof} ⦉

  ‖ The $L^p$ spaces are nested ⦉

  ‖ for finite measures. ⦉

  ‖ \end{proof} ⦉

  ‖ \end{prop} ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ \begin{prop} ⦉

  ‖ The variance of a square-integrable real-valued random
    variable is the expectation of the square of the difference
    between the random variable and its expectation. ⦉
