\stitle{Solving Equations}

\ssection{Why}

If I am holding
3 stones
in both hands,
and I have two of
them in my left hand,
how many might I have
in my right hand?
If I am holding
fewer than 5 pebbles, how
many might I have in my right hand?

\ssection{Overview}

I am
asserting above
that I have three
pebbles and that
I have two in my
left hand.
We know that the
total nu
A solution of
the equation
is any possible
number of pebbles
I could be holding
in my right hand
such that the sum
is three.

We define the $\text{find}$
function.

Discuss solutions
in a set.
Discuss existence
of solution.
Discuss uniqueness
of solution.

\ssubsection{Notation}

We can
denote the pebble
equation as
find $n$ so that
\[
  2 + n = 3
\]
