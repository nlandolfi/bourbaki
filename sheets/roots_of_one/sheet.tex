  \section*{Definition}

The equation
    \[
x^p = 1
    \]
has $p$ roots and these are called the $p$ roots of 1.\footnote{Future editions will expand.}
We call the complex numbers which solve this equation the \t{$p$th roots of one} or the \t{($p$th) roots of unity}.

A $n$th root of unity $r \in \R $ is \t{primitive} if it is not an $m$th root of unity for any $m < n$.
