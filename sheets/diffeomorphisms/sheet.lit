§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to think about two abstract spaces as being
    equivalent.

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $X ⊂ 𝗥^n$ and $Y ⊂ 𝗥^m$. ⦉

  ‖ A smooth, invertible function $f: X → Y$ is a
    ❬diffeomorphism❭ $f^{-1}$ is smooth. ⦉

  ‖ $X$ and $Y$ are ❬diffeomorphic❭ if such a function exists. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The key is the relation diffeomorphic is an equivalence
    relation. ⦉

  ‖ It is reflexive because the identity map is smooth and
    invertible. ⦉

  ‖ It is symmetric since if $f$ is a diffeomorphism from $X$
    to $Y$ then $f^{-1}$ is a diffeomorphism from $Y$ to $X$. ⦉

  ‖ It is transitive because the composition of two smooth
    functions is smooth. ⦉
⦉

§§ Differential Topology ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Differential topology studies properties of $X ⊂ 𝗥^n$ which
    do not change under diffeomorphism. ⦉
