\section*{Why}

We want to think about two abstract spaces as being equivalent.\footnote{Future editions will include.}

\section*{Definition}

Let $X \subset \R ^n$ and $Y \subset \R ^m$.
A smooth, invertible function $f: X \to Y$ is a \t{diffeomorphism} $f^{-1}$ is smooth.
$X$ and $Y$ are \t{diffeomorphic} if such a function exists.

The key is the relation diffeomorphic is an equivalence relation.
It is reflexive because the identity map is smooth and invertible.
It is symmetric since if $f$ is a diffeomorphism from $X$ to $Y$ then $f^{-1}$ is a diffeomorphism from $Y$ to $X$.
It is transitive because the composition of two smooth functions is smooth.

\subsection*{Differential Topology}

Differential topology studies properties of $X \subset \R ^n$ which do not change under diffeomorphism.
