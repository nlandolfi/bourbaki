§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Do solutions exist to a linear optimization problem which is
    feasible and bounded? Yes. ⦉
⦉

§ Result ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Suppose $A ∈ 𝗥^{m × n}$, $b ∈ 𝗥^n$, and $c ∈ 𝗥^n$ so
    that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ P = \Set{x ∈ 𝗥^n}{Ax ≤ b} ≠ ∅ ⦉
    ⦉
    and
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ δ = \inf \Set{c^⊤x}{x ∈ P} > -∞ ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Then there exists $x^★ ∈ 𝗥^n$ with $c^⊤x^★ = δ$. ⦉
</statement>
¶ ⦊
  ‖ For this reason, a linear program is sometimes abbreviated
    $\min\Set{cx}{Ax ≤ b}$ instead of $\inf\set{c^⊤ x}{Ax ≤ b}$. ⦉
