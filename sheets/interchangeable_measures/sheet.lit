§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to compute integrals with respect to arbitrary
    measures. ⦉

  ‖ If we find a special measure with which we can compute
    integrals, would there be some way to translate integrals
    against another measure into integrals against this special
    measure? ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ It would suffice to produce a special function ⦉

  ‖ whose integral against the base measure ⦉

  ‖ would over any measurable set gave ⦉

  ‖ the measure of the set under the alternate ⦉

  ‖ measure. ⦉

  ‖ In this case, the monotone convergence ⦉

  ‖ theorem would say that the integral of ⦉

  ‖ any function under the alternate ⦉

  ‖ measure was the integral of the function ⦉

  ‖ against the special function under the ⦉

  ‖ base measure. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ No small miracle is that the condition ⦉

  ‖ for this interchange is extremely simple. ⦉

  ‖ In this sheet, we will define the ⦉

  ‖ condition. In a later sheet we will ⦉

  ‖ construct the special function. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Consider two measures. ⦉

  ‖ Suppose there exists a measurable set for which the first
    was positive but the second was zero. ⦉

  ‖ Then we have no hope of interchanging these measures,
    because the integral of any function over this set against
    the second measure is zero. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ So let us rule out this case. ⦉

  ‖ Suppose that whenever the first was positive on a set, the
    second was positive on that set. ⦉

  ‖ The contrapositive is that whenever the second is zero on a
    set, the first is zero on the same. ⦉

  ‖ This condition is sufficient for interchangeability. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A first measure is ❬interchangeable❭ with respect to a
    second measure if the first measure of any measurable set is
    zero whenever the second measure of that set is zero.
    † ⦊
      ‖ The language “interchangeable” is not at all standard. We
        have coined it for the reasons outlined in the why of
        this sheet. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ As we said earlier, this condition means that the first
    measure is never nonzero on a set for which the second
    measure is zero. ⦉

  ‖ It is common to say that the first measure is ❬absolutely
    continuous❭ with respect to the second measure.
    † ⦊
      ‖ This needs more justification, perhaps, as this naming
        seems to be an artifact of a notion of absolutely
        continuous functions. ⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜)$ be a measurable space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $μ$ and $ν$ be two measures on $𝒜$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $ν$ is interchangeable with respect to $μ$ if for all
    measurable $A ∈ 𝒜$, $μ(A) = 0 ⟹ ν(A) = 0$. ⦉

  ‖ Equivalently, $ν(A) > 0 ⟹ μ(A) > 0$ for all $A ∈ 𝒜$. ⦉

  ‖ Notice that in this second statement, instead of the
    relation of equality ($=$) we are using the relation of
    inequality ($<$). ⦉

  <!-- We need not consider negative real numbers since $\mu$ is a non-negative real-valued function. -->
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ There is often used notation for a measure $μ$ being
    interchangeable (absolutely continuous) with respect to a
    second measure $ν$. ⦉

  ‖ It is $μ ≪ ν$. ⦉

  ‖ The notation is a reminder of the fact that $ν(A) = 0 ⟹
    μ(A) = 0$ for all $A ∈ 𝒜$. ⦉
