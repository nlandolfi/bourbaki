§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We generalize our notion of ‹size› to $n$-dimensional space. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬norm❭ (or ❬Euclidean norm❭) of $x ∈ 𝗥^n$ is
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + ⋯ + x_n^2}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the norm of $x$ by $\norm{x}$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, $\norm{\cdot}: 𝗥^n → 𝗥$ is a function from
    vectors to real numbers. ⦉

  ‖ The notation follows the notation of absolute value, the
    ‹magnitude› of a real number, and the double verticals remind
    us that $x$ is a vector. ⦉

  ‖ A warning: some authors write $\abs{x}$ for the norm of $x$
    when it is understood that $x ∈ 𝗥^n$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We understand the norm of $x$ by comparison with the
    distance function $d: 𝗥^n × 𝗥^n → 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ On one hand, the norm of $x$ is $d(x, 0)$. ⦉

  ‖ So $\norm{x}$ measures the length of the vector $x$ from
    the origin $0$. ⦉

  ‖ On the other hand, $d(x, y) = \norm{x - y}$. ⦉

  ‖ So $\norm{x - y}$ measures the distance between $x$ and $y$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Properties ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The norm has several important properties:
    𝍫 ⦊
      ‣ $\norm{\alpha x} = \abs{\alpha}\norm{x}$, called ❬(absolute)
        homogeneity❭, ⦉

      ‣ $\norm{x + y} ≤ \norm{x} + \norm{y}$, called the
        ❬triangle inequality❭, ⦉

      ‣ $\norm{x} ≥ 0$, called ❬non-negativity❭, and ⦉

      ‣ $\norm{x} = 0 \iff x = 0$, called ❬definiteness❭. ⦉
