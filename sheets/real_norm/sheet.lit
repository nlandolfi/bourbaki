  ‖ The ❬norm❭ (❬Euclidean norm❭) of $x ∈ 𝗥^n$ is
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + ⋯ + x_n^2}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ We denote the norm of $x$ by $\norm{x}$. ⦉

  ‖ The notation follows the notation of absolute value, the
    ‹magnitude› of a real number, and the double verticals remind
    us that $x$ is a vector (warning: some authors write
    $\abs{x}$ for the norm of $x$ when it is understood that $x
    ∈ 𝗥^n$). ⦉

  ‖ In other words, $\norm{\cdot}: 𝗥^n → \R$ is a function from
    vectors to real numbers. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We understand the norm of $x$ by comparison with the
    distance function $d: 𝗥^n × 𝗥^n → 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ On one hand, the norm of $x$ is $d(x, 0)$. ⦉

  ‖ So $\norm{x}$ measures the length of the vector $x$ from
    the origin $0$. ⦉

  ‖ On the other hand, $d(x, y) = \norm{x - y}$. ⦉

  ‖ So $\norm{x - y}$ measures the distance between $x$ and $y$. ⦉
