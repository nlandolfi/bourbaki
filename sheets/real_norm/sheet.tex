\ssection{Why}
We want to measure the size of vectors in $\R^n$.

\ssection{Definition}
The \t{norm} (\t{Euclidean norm}) of $x \in \R^n$ is
  \[
\sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \cdots + x_n^2}.
  \]
We denote the norm of $x$ by $\norm{x}$.
In other words, $\norm{\cdot}: \R^n \to \R$ is a function from vectors to real numbers.

We understand the norm of $x$ by comparison with the distance function $d: \R^n \times \R^n \to \R$.
On one hand, the norm of $x$ is $d(x, 0)$.
So $\norm{x}$ measures the length of the vector $x$ from the origin $0$.
On the other hand, $d(x, y) = \norm{x - y}$.
So $\norm{x - y}$ measures the distance between $x$ and $y$.

\ssubsection{Properties}
The norm has several important properties
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\norm{\alpha x} = \abs{\alpha}\norm{x}$, called \t{(absolute) homogeneity}
  \item $\norm{x + y} \leq \norm{x} + \norm{y}$, called the \t{triangle inequality}
  \item $\norm{x} \geq 0$, called \t{non-negativity}
  \item $\norm{x} = 0 \iff x = 0$, called \t{definiteness}
  \end{enumerate}
