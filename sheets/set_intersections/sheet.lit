§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We can consider intersections of more than two sets. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $𝒜$ denote a set of sets. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, every element of $𝒜$ is a set. ⦉

  ‖ And suppose that $𝒜$ has at least one set (i.e., $𝒜 ≠ ∅$). ⦉

  ‖ Let $C$ denote a set such that $C ∈ 𝒜$. ⦉

  ‖ Then consider the set,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \Set{x ∈ C}{(∀ A)(A ∈ 𝒜 ⟹ x ∈ A)}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ This set exists by the principle of specification (see␣
    <a href='sheets/set_specification.html'>
      ‖ Set Specification ⦉
    </a>
    ). ⦉

  ‖ Moreover, the set does not depend on which set we picked. ⦉

  ‖ So the dependence on $C$ does not matter. ⦉

  ‖ It is unique by the axiom of extension (see␣
    <a href='/sheets/set_equation.html'>
      ‖ Set Equality ⦉
    </a>
    ). ⦉

  ‖ This set is called the ❬intersection❭ of $𝒜$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the intersection of $𝒜$ by $\bigcap 𝒜$. ⦉
⦉

§ Equivalence with pair intersections ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ As desired, the the set denoted by $𝒜$ is a pair (see␣
    <a href='/sheets/unordered_pairs.html'>
      ‖ Unordered Pairs ⦉
    </a>
    ) of sets, the pair intersection (see␣
    <a href='/sheets/pair_intersections.html'>
      ‖ Pair Intersections ⦉
    </a>
    ) coincides with intersection as we have defined it in this
    sheet.
