⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We can consider intersections of more than two sets. ⦉
⦉

  ‖ \ssection{Definition} ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $𝒜$ denote a set of sets. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, every element of $𝒜$ is a set. ⦉

  ‖ And suppose that $𝒜$ has at least one set (i.e., $𝒜 ≠ ∅$). ⦉

  ‖ Let $C$ denote a set such that $C ∈ 𝒜$. ⦉

  ‖ Then consider the set,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \Set{x ∈ C}{(∀ A)(A ∈ 𝒜 ⟹ x ∈ A)}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ This set exists by the principle of specification (see
    \sheetref{set_specification}{Set Specification}). ⦉

  ‖ Moreover, the set does not depend on which set we picked. ⦉

  ‖ So the dependence on $C$ does not matter. ⦉

  ‖ It is unique by the axiom of extension (see
    \sheetref{set_equality}{Set Equality}). ⦉

  ‖ This set is called the ❬intersection❭ of $𝒜$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ \ssubsection{Notation} ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the intersection of $𝒜$ by $\bigcap 𝒜$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ \ssection{Equivalence with pair intersections} ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ As desired, the the set denoted by $𝒜$ is a pair (see
    \sheetref{unordered_pairs}{Unordered Pairs}) of sets, the pair
    intersection (see \sheetref{pair_intersections}{Pair
    Intersections}) coincides with intersection as we have defined
    it in this sheet.
