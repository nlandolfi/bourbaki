\stitle{Set Intersections}

\ssection{Why}

We want to consider the elements which are shared between two sets.
Does a set exist which contains all the elements whcih appear in both of one set and other.

\ssection{Definition}

Yes.
The \t{intersection} of one set with another is the set obtained by specifying the elements of the former set which are members of the latter set.
The intersection is symmetric.
The intersection of one set with another is the same as the latter set with the former.
