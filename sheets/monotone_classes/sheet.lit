§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬limit❭ of an increasing sequence of sets is the family
    union of the sequence. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬limit❭ of a decreasing sequence of sets is the family
    intersection of the sequence. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬monotone limit❭ of an sequence of sets is the limit of
    a monotone sequence. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬monotone class❭ is a subset system in which monotone
    limits of monotone sequences of distinguished sets are
    distinguished. ⦉

  ‖ We call the distinguished sets a ❬monotone class❭. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A$ a non-empty set with partial order $≼$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $(A, 𝒜)$ be a subset space on $A$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $\seq{A}$ be an increasing or decreasing sequence in
    $\mathcal{A}$. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the limit of $\seq{A}$ by $\lim_{n} \seqt{A}$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ If $\seq{A}$ is increasing, $\lim_n \seqt{A} = ∪_{n}
    \seqt{A}$. ⦉

  ‖ If $\seq{A}$ is decreasing, $\lim_n \seqt{A} = ∩_{n}
    \seqt{A}$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ If $(A, 𝒜)$ is a monotone space, then for all monotone
    $\seq{A}$ in $𝒜$, $\lim_{n} \seqt{A} ∈ 𝒜$. ⦉

  ‖ In this case, $𝒜$ is a montone class. ⦉
