\ssection{Why}


\ssection{Definition}


The
\ct{limit}{}
of an increasing sequence
of sets is the family
union of the sequence.
The
\ct{limit}{}
of a decreasing sequence
of sets is the family
intersection of the sequence.

A
\ct{monotone limit}{}
of an sequence of sets
is the limit of a
monotone sequence.

A
\ct{monotone class}{}
is a
subset system in which
monotone limits of
 monotone sequences
of distinguished sets are distinguished.
We call the distinguished sets a
\ct{monotone class}{}.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $A$ a non-empty set with
partial order $\preceq$.
Let $(A, \mathcal{A})$ be a
subset space on $A$.

Let $\seq{A}$ be an increasing
or decreasing sequence in $\mathcal{A}$.
We denote the limit of $\seq{A}$
by $\lim_{n} \seqt{A}$.

If $\seq{A}$ is increasing,
$\lim_n \seqt{A} = \union_{n} \seqt{A}$.
If $\seq{A}$ is decreasing,
$\lim_n \seqt{A} = \intersection_{n} \seqt{A}$.

If $(A, \mathcal{A})$ is a monotone space,
then for all monotone
$\seq{A}$ in $\mathcal{A}$,
$\lim_{n} \seqt{A} \in \mathcal{A}$.
In this case, $\mathcal{A}$ is a montone class.
