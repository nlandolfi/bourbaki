\section*{Definition}

The \t{limit} of an increasing sequence of sets is the family union of the sequence.
The \t{limit} of a decreasing sequence of sets is the family intersection of the sequence.

A \t{monotone limit} of an sequence of sets is the limit of a monotone sequence.

A \t{monotone class} is a subset system in which monotone limits of monotone sequences of distinguished sets are distinguished.
We call the distinguished sets a \t{monotone class}.

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $A$ a non-empty set with partial order $\preceq$.
Let $(A, \mathcal{A} )$ be a subset space on $A$.

Let $\seq{A}$ be an increasing or decreasing sequence in $\mathcal{A}$.
We denote the limit of $\seq{A}$ by $\lim_{n} \seqt{A}$.

If $\seq{A}$ is increasing, $\lim_n \seqt{A} = \cup_{n} \seqt{A}$.
If $\seq{A}$ is decreasing, $\lim_n \seqt{A} = \cap _{n} \seqt{A}$.

If $(A, \mathcal{A} )$ is a monotone space, then for all monotone $\seq{A}$ in $\mathcal{A} $, $\lim_{n} \seqt{A} \in \mathcal{A} $.
In this case, $\mathcal{A} $ is a montone class.
