§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We name and denote subsets of the set of real numbers
    which correspond to segments of a line. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Take two real numbers, with the first less than the second. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ An ❬interval❭ is one of four sets:
    𝍫 ⦊
      ‣ ‖ the set of real numbers larger than the first number and
          smaller than the second; we call the interval ❬open❭. ⦉⦉

      ‣ the set of real numbers larger than or equal to the
        first number and smaller than or equal to the second
        number; we call the interval ❬closed❭. ⦉

      ‣ the set of real numbers larger than the first number
        and smaller than or equal to the second; we call the
        interval ❬open on the left❭ and ❬closed on the right❭ ⦉

      ‣ the set of real numbers larger than or equal to the
        first number and smaller than the second; we call the
        interval ❬closed on the left❭ and ❬open on the right❭. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ If an interval is neither open nor closed we call it
    ❬half-open❭ or ❬half-closed❭ ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We call the two numbers the ❬endpoints❭ of the interval. ⦉

  ‖ An open interval does not contain its endpoints. ⦉

  ‖ A closed interval contains its endpoints. ⦉

  ‖ A half-open/half-closed interval contains only one of its
    endpoints. ⦉

  ‖ We say that the endpoints ❬delimit❭ the interval. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $a, b$ be two real numbers which satisfy the relation
    $a < b$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the open interval from $a$ to $b$ by $\oi{a, b}$. ⦉

  ‖ This notation, although standard, is the same as that for
    ordered pairs; no confusion arises with adequate context.
    † ⦊
      ‖ In future editions, we may use $\oleft(a, b\oright)$ or
        even $\oleft[\,a, b\,\oright]$. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the closed interval from $a$ to $b$ by $\ci{a,
    b}$. ⦉

  ‖ We record the fact $\oi{a, b} ⊂ \ci{a, b}$ in our new
    notation. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the half-open interval from $a$ to $b$, closed on
    the right, by $\oci{a, b}$ and the half-open interval from
    $a$ to $b$, closed on the left, by $\coi{a, b}$.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Some authors use ]a, b], [a, b[ and ]a, b[. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬unit interval❭ is the set $\ci{0_{𝗥}, 1_{𝗥}}$ and we
    sometimes denote it by $\I$. ⦉
