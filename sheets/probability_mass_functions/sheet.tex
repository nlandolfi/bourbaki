\ssection{Definition}

A
\ct{probability mass function}{}
is a real-valued function
from a set of outcomes which is
non-negative and whose sum over
of results over the set of outcomes
is one.

\ssubsection{Notation}


Let $A$ be a set of outcomes and
let $R$ be the set of real numbers.
Let $p: \Outcomes \to R$ be such that

\begin{itemize}

\item $p(a) > 0$ for each $a \in A$ and
\item $\sum_{a \in A} p(a) = 1$

\end{itemize}
