\section*{Why}

We want to measure angles in space.\footnote{Future editions will include pictures.}

\section*{Definition}

The \t{space inner product} (or \t{dot product}, \t{scalar product}) of two real vectors $x, y \in \R ^3$ is
\[
x_1y_1 + x_2y_2 + x_3y_3
\]

\subsection*{Notation}

We denote the inner product of $x$ and $y$ by $\ip{x,y}$.
