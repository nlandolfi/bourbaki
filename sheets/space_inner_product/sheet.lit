§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to measure angles in space.

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬space inner product❭ (or ❬dot product❭, ❬scalar
    product❭) of two real vectors $x, y ∈ 𝗥^3$ is
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ x_1y_1 + x_2y_2 + x_3y_3 ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the inner product of $x$ and $y$ by $\ip{x,y}$. ⦉
