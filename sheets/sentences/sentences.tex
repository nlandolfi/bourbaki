\ssection{Why}

We want to say things
about objects and sets
of objects.

\ssection{Discussion}

An \ct{assertion}{}
is a sequence of symbols
which is assumed to be true.

Let $a$ be an object.
Let $A$ be a set.
A \ct{membership assertion}{}
is $a \in A$.
Notice that $\in$ is not symmetric.
$a \in A$ does not assert the same
meaning as
$A \in a$.

Let $b$ be an object.
An \ct{identity assertion}{}
is $a = b$.
Notice that $a = b$
asserts the same as $b = a$.

A \ct{primitive sentence}{}
is a belonging assertion
or an equality assertion.
The symbolism used includes
three pieces: the names of the two
objects and the symbols $\in$ or $=$.

A \ct{logical form}{} is one of
several structures:
\begin{enumerate}

  \item

    and

  \item

    or (in the sense of \say{--- or --- or both})

  \item

    not

  \item

    implies (in the sense of \say{if ---, then ---}

  \item

    if and only if

  \item

    for some

  \item

    for all
\end{enumerate}

This list is redundant.

A \ct{sentence}{} primitive sentence
or a logical form with a primitive
sentence or a logical form with
sentences.
