\section*{Definition}

A set $C \subset \R ^n$ is \t{convex} if it contains the closed line segment between every pair of points.
In the notation of closed line segments, $C$ is convex if
\[
[x, y] \subset C \quad \text{for all } x, y \in C
\]
In other words,
\[
\lambda x + (1-\lambda )y \in C \quad \text{for all } x, y \in C \text{ and } \lambda  \in [0,1].
\]

Roughly speaking, $C$ is convex if and only if its intersection with every line in $\R ^n$ is either empty or a closed line segment.

\subsection*{Examples}

The empty set, any singleton, any subspace, any affine set and any halfspace.

\subsection*{Properties}

\begin{proposition}[closure under intersections]
Suppose $\mathcal{K}  \subset \powerset{\R ^d}$ is a set of convex sets.
Then $\bigcap\mathcal{K} $ is convex.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}[sums, differences, scales are convex]
Suppose $A, B \subset \R ^d$ are convex sets.
Then $A + B$, $A - B$ and $\lambda A$ for any real $\lambda $ is convex.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}[closure, interior]
If $A \subset \R ^d$ is convex, then $\cl(A)$ and $\Int(A)$ are convex.\footnote{For the first, use $\cl(A) = \bigcap_{\mu  > 0} (A + \mu B)$ where $B$ is unit ball of $\R ^d$.}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}[interior line segments]
Suppose $A \subset \R ^d$ is convex, $x \in A$ and $y \in \Int(a)$.
Then all points of the line segement between $x$ and $y$ are members of $\Int(A)$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}[images of affine maps]
Suppose $T: \R ^d \to \R ^d$ is affine.
If $A \subset \R ^d$ is convex, then $T(A)$ is convex.
\end{proposition}
