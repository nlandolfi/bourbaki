\section*{Definition}

A set $C \subset \R ^n$ is \t{convex} if it contains the closed line segment between every pair of distinct points.
In other words,
\[
\lambda x + (1-\lambda )y \in C \quad \text{for all } x, y \in C \text{ and } \lambda  \in [0,1].
\]

Roughly speaking, $C$ is convex if and only if its intersection with every line in $\R ^n$ is either empty or a closed line segment.

\subsection*{Examples}

The empty set, any singleton, any subspace, any affine set and any halfspace.

\subsection*{Properties}

\begin{proposition}[closure under intersections]
Suppose $\mathcal{K}  \subset \powerset{\R ^n}$ is a set of convex sets.
Then $\cap  \mathcal{K} $ is convex.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}[sums, differences, scales are convex]
Suppose $A, B$ are convex sets.
Then $A + B$, $A - B$ and $\lambda A$ for any real $\lambda $ is convex.
\end{proposition}
