§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A set $C ⊂ 𝗥^n$ is ❬convex❭ if it contains the closed
    line segment between every pair of points. ⦉

  ‖ In the notation of closed line segments, $C$ is convex if
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ [x, y] ⊂ C \quad \text{for all } x, y ∈ C ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ In other words,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ λx + (1-λ)y ∈ C \quad \text{for all } x, y ∈ C
        \text{ and } λ ∈ [0,1]. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Roughly speaking, $C$ is convex if and only if its
    intersection with every line in $𝗥^n$ is either empty or a
    closed line segment. ⦉

§§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The empty set, any singleton, any subspace, any affine set
    and any halfspace. ⦉

§§ Properties ⦉
<statement type='proposition' text='closure under intersections'>
  ‖ Suppose $𝒦 ⊂ \powerset{𝗥^d}$ is a set of convex sets. ⦉

  ‖ Then $⋂𝒦$ is convex. ⦉
</statement>
<statement type='proposition' text='sums, differences, scales are convex'>
  ‖ Suppose $A, B ⊂ 𝗥^d$ are convex sets. ⦉

  ‖ Then $A + B$, $A - B$ and $λA$ for any real $λ$ is
    convex. ⦉
</statement>
<statement type='proposition' text='closure, interior'>
  ‖ If $A ⊂ 𝗥^d$ is convex, then $\cl(A)$ and $\Int(A)$ are
    convex.
    † ⦊
      ‖ For the first, use $\cl(A) = ⋂_{μ > 0} (A + μB)$
        where $B$ is unit ball of $𝗥^d$. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
</statement>
<statement type='proposition' text='interior line segments'>
  ‖ Suppose $A ⊂ 𝗥^d$ is convex, $x ∈ A$ and $y ∈ \Int(a)$. ⦉

  ‖ Then all points of the line segement between $x$ and $y$
    are members of $\Int(A)$. ⦉
</statement>
<statement type='proposition' text='images of affine maps'>
  ‖ Suppose $T: 𝗥^d → 𝗥^d$ is affine. ⦉

  ‖ If $A ⊂ 𝗥^d$ is convex, then $T(A)$ is convex. ⦉
