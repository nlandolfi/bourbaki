§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A set $C ⊂ 𝗥^n$ is ❬convex❭ if it contains the closed
    line segment between every pair of distinct points. ⦉

  ‖ In other words,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ λx + (1-λ)y ∈ C \quad \text{for all } x, y ∈ C
        \text{ and } λ ∈ [0,1]. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Roughly speaking, $C$ is convex if and only if its
    intersection with every line in $𝗥^n$ is either empty or a
    closed line segment. ⦉
⦉

§§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The empty set, any singleton, any subspace, any affine set
    and any halfspace. ⦉
⦉

§§ Properties ⦉
<statement type='proposition' text='closure under intersections'>
  ‖ Suppose $𝒦 ⊂ \powerset{𝗥^n}$ is a set of convex sets. ⦉

  ‖ Then $∩ 𝒦$ is convex. ⦉
</statement>
<statement type='proposition' text='sums, differences, scales are convex'>
  ‖ Suppose $A, B$ are convex sets. ⦉

  ‖ Then $A + B$, $A - B$ and $λA$ for any real $λ$ is
    convex. ⦉
