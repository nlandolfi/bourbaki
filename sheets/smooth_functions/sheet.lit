§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ What is the generalisation of smooth functions between
    Euclidean spaces. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $U ⊂ 𝗥^n$ be open. ⦉

  ‖ A function $f: U → 𝗥^m$ is ❬smooth❭ if each of its
    components is smooth. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ More generally, let $X ⊂ 𝗥^n$ (not necessarily open). ⦉

  ‖ We call $g: X → 𝗥^m$ smooth if for each $x ∈ X$ there
    exists an open set $V ⊂ 𝗥^n$ with $x ∈ V$ and smooth
    function $G: U → 𝗥^n$ so that $G(y) = g(y)$ for all $y ∈
    U ∩ X$. ⦉

  ‖ In this case we say that $g$ can be ❬locally extended❭ to
    a smooth map on open sets. ⦉
