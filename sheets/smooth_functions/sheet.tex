\ssection{Why}

What is the generalisation of smooth functions between Euclidean spaces.

\ssection{Definition}

Let $U \subset \R^n$ be open.
A function $f: U \to \R^m$ is \t{smooth} if each of its components is smooth.

More generally, let $X \subset \R^n$ (not necessarily open).
We call $g: X \to \R^m$ smooth if for each $x \in X$ there exists an open set $V \subset \R^n$ with $x \in V$ and smooth function $G: U \to \R^n$ so that $G(y) = g(y)$ for all $y \in U \intersect X$.
In this case we say that $g$ can be \t{locally extended} to a smooth map on open sets.
