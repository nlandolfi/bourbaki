\section*{Why}

What is the distance between two points in a plane?

\section*{Definition}

We define the distance between two points in the plane as the length of the line segment connecting them.\footnote{This intuition will be expanded in future editions.}
In terms of their coordinates $(x_1, x_2), (y_1, y_2) \in \R ^2$, the \t{plane distance} of two points is
\[
\sqrt{(x_1 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - y_2)^2}.
\]
This is sometimes referred to as the \t{Euclidean distance}.
We have thus defined a function mapping $\R ^2 \times \R ^2$ into $\R $.
