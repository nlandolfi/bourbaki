§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ What is the distance between two points in a plane? ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We define the distance between two points in the plane as
    the length of the line segment connecting them.
    † ⦊
      ‖ This intuition will be expanded in future editions. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ In terms of their coordinates $(x_1, x_2), (y_1, y_2) ∈
    𝗥^2$, the ❬plane distance❭ of two points is
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ √{(x_1 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - y_2)^2}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ This is sometimes referred to as the ❬Euclidean distance❭. ⦉

  ‖ We have thus defined a function mapping $𝗥^2 ×𝗥^2$ into $𝗥$. ⦉
