\section*{Definition}

The \t{translate} of a subset of a vector space \t{by} a given vector is the set of all vectors which are the sum of a vector in the subset with the given vector.

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $(V, \F )$ be a vector space.
Let $M \subset V$ and $a \in V$.
The translate of $M$ by $a$ is the set
\[
\Set*{x + a}{x \in M},
\]
which we denote by $M + a$.
