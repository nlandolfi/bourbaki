§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to subtract numbers.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will change this why. In particular, by

        ␣and the lack thereof in $ω$. ⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Consider the set $ω ×ω$. ⦉

  ‖ This set is the set of ordered pairs of $ω$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, the ordered pairs of natural numbers. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We call two such pairs $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$ of $ω × ω$
    ❬integer equivalent❭ if
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ a + d = b + c ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Briefly, the intuition is that $(a, b)$ represents $a$ less
    $b$, or in the usual notation “$a - b$”.
    † ⦊
      ‖ This account will be expanded in future editions. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ So this equivalence relation says these two are the same if
    $a - b = c - d$. ⦉

  ‖ Rearranging gives $a + d = b + c$. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Integer equivalence is an equivalence relation.
    † ⦊
      ‖ The proof is straightforward. It will be included in
        future editions. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
</statement>
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬set of integer numbers❭ is the set of equivalence
    classes (see␣
    <a href='/sheets/equivalence_relations.html'>
      ‖ Equivalence Relations ⦉
    </a>
    ) under integer equivalence on $ω × ω$. ⦉

  ‖ We call an element an ❬integer number❭ (or ❬integer❭). ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the set of integers by $𝗭$. ⦉

  ‖ If we denote integer equivalence by $∼$ then $𝗭 = (ω
    ×ω)/\mathord{∼}$. ⦉
