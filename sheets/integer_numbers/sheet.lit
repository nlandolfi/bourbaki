§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to subtract numbers.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will change this why. In particular, by
        referencing \sheetref{inverse_elements}{Inverse Elements} and
        the lack thereof in $ω$. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Consider the set $ω ×ω$. ⦉

  ‖ This set is the set of ordered pairs of $ω$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, the ordered pairs of natural numbers. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We say that two of these ordered pairs $(a, b)$ and $(c,
    d)$ is ❬integer equivalent❭ the $a + d = b +c$. ⦉

  ‖ Briefly, the intuition is that $(a, b)$ represents $a$ less
    $b$, or in the usual notation “$a - b$”.
    † ⦊
      ‖ This account will be expanded in future editions. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ So this equivalence relation says these two are the same if
    $a - b = c - d$ or else $a + d = b + c$. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Integer equivalence is an equivalence relation.
    † ⦊
      ‖ The proof is straightforward. It will be included in
        future editions. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
</statement>
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We define the ❬set of integer numbers❭ to be the set of
    equivalence classes (see
    \sheetref{equivalence_relations}{Equivalence Relations}) under
    integer equivalence on $ω ×ω$. ⦉

  ‖ We call an element of the set of integer numbers an
    ❬integer number❭ or an ❬integer❭. ⦉

  ‖ We call the set of integer numbers the ❬set of integers❭
    or ❬integers❭ for short. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the set of integers by $𝗭$. ⦉

  ‖ If we denote integer equivalence by $∼$ then $𝗭 = (ω
    ×ω)∕∼$. ⦉
