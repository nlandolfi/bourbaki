§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ How does the power set relate to an intersection? ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation preliminaries ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ First, if we have a set of sets—denote it $𝒞$—and all
    members are subsets of a fixed set—denote it $E$—then the
    set of sets is a subset of $\powerset{E}$. ⦉

  ‖ In this case, we can write
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ ⋂ \Set{X ∈ \powerset{E}}{x ∈ 𝒞} ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Which is a sort of justification for the notation
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ ⋂_{X ∈ 𝒞} X. ⦉

§ Basic properties ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Here are some basic interactions between the powerset and
    intersections.
