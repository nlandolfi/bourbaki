\section*{Definition}

Let $A \subset \R $ open.
Let $f: A \to \R $ be differentiable with derivative $f': \R \to \R $.
We call $f$ \t{twice differentiable} (or \t{two times differentiable}) if its derivative $f'$ is differentiable.
In this case, we call the derivative of $f'$ the \t{second derivative} of $f$.

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $A \subset R$.
The second derivative of the twice-differentiable function $f: A \to \R $ is sometimes denoted $f''(x): A \to \R $
