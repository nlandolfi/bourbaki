§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A ⊂ 𝗥$ open. ⦉

  ‖ Let $f: A → 𝗥$ be differentiable with derivative $f': 𝗥 →
    𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ We call $f$ ❬twice differentiable❭ (or ❬two times
    differentiable❭) if its derivative $f'$ is differentiable. ⦉

  ‖ In this case, we call the derivative of $f'$ the ❬second
    derivative❭ of $f$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A ⊂ R$. ⦉

  ‖ The second derivative of the twice-differentiable function $f:
    A → 𝗥$ is sometimes denoted $f''(x): A → 𝗥$ ⦉
