\ssection{Why}

We want to discuss real-valued random functions whose family of random variables have simple densities.\footnote{Future editions will expand.}

\ssection{Definition}

A \t{normal random function} is a real-valued random function whose family of real-valued random variables has the property that any subfamily is jointly normal.

For this reason, we call the family of random variables corresponding to the random function a \t{normal process} or \t{Gaussian process}.\footnote{As usual, The choice of \say{normal} is a result of the Bourbaki project's convention to eschew historical names. Though here, as in \sheetref{multivariate_normals}{Multivariate Normals} the language of the project is nonstandard.}

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(\Omega, \CA, \PM)$ be a probability space and $A$ a set.
Let $x: \Omega \to (A \to \R)$ be a random function with family $y: A \to (\Omega \to \R)$.

The random function $x$ is a normal if, for all $a^1, \dots, a^m \in A$, $(y(a^1), \dots, y(a^m))$ is jointly normal.

\ssection{Mean and covariance function}

\begin{proposition}
  Let $x: \Omega \to (A \to \R)$ be a normal random function with family $X: A \to (\Omega \to \R)$.
  There exists unique functions $m: A \to \R$ and $k: A \times A \to \R$ so that the mean of the random variable $X_a$ is $m(a)$ for all $A$ and the covariance of the random variables $X_a$ and $X_{a'}$ is $k(a, a')$ for all $a, a' \in A$.\footnote{Future editions may include an account.}
\end{proposition}
For this reason, we call $m$ the \t{mean function} and $k$ the \t{covariance function} of the random function.

Conversely, suppose that we have function $m: A \to \R$ and $k: A \times A \to \R$.
Then if $k$ satisfies the property that for all $a^1, \dots, a^m$, the $m \times m$ matrix
\[
  \pmat{
    k(a^1, a^1) & \cdot k(a^1, a^m) \\
    \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    k(a^m, a^1) & \cdots k(a^m, a^m) \\
  }
\]
is positive semidefinite, then we can construct a Gaussian process from $m$ and $k$ as its mean and covariance function.

\ssubsection{Random function interpretation}

Many authorities discuss a normal random function as \say{putting a prior} on a \say{space} (see, for example, \sheetref{real_function_space}{Real Function Space}) of functions.
One samples functions by drawing an outcome $\omega \in \Omega$, and then defining the sample $f: I \to \R$ by $f(i) = x(i)(\omega)$.

\ssubsection{Multivariate normal special case}

If the index set is finite, and can be ordered, then the normal random function is in one-to-one correspondence with the multivariate normal random vectors.
