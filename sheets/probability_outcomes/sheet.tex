\ssection{Why}

When talking about cases which
may or may not happen, we need
to enumerate or concieve of the
set of possibilities.

\ssection{Definition}

A \t{set of outcomes} is a set.
A set of outcomes may by finite or infinite.
We call an element of the set of outcomes an \t{outcome}.

Some authors call the set of outcomces the \t{set of samples} and call an outcome a \t{sample}.
They also will speak of the set of outcomes as the \t{sample space}.
We avoid this terminology for various reasons.\footnote{To be clarified in future editions. }
