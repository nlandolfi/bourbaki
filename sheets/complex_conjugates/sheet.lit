§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬complex conjugate❭ (or ❬conjugate❭) of a complex number
    $z$ is the complex number whose real part matches $z$ and
    whose imaginary part is the additive inverse of $z$. ⦉

  ‖ The complex conjugate of a purely real number is the same
    purely real number. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, the complex conjugate of a complex number
    with no imaginary part is the same complex number. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the complex conjugate of the complex number $z ∈
    𝗖$ by $\Cconj{z}$. ⦉

  ‖ Other common notation includes $\bar{z}$, read “z bar”. ⦉

  ‖ If there exists $a, b ∈ 𝗥$ so that $z = (a, b)$, then
    $\Cconj{z} = (a, -b)$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Geometric interpretation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Taking the conjugate of a complex numbers corresponds to a
    reflection across the real axis in the plane. ⦉
⦉

§§ Properties ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A complex number $z$ is real if and only if $z =
    \Cconj{z}$ and it is imaginar if and only if $z =
    -\Cconj{z}$. ⦉

  ‖ For $z ∈ 𝗖$, we have
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ ℜ(z) = \frac{z + \Cconj{z}}{2} \quad \text{ and } ℑ(z)
        = \frac{z - \Cconj{z}}{2i}. ⦉
