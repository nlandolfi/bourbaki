§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A set $A ∈ 𝗥^n$ is ❬semialgebraic❭ if there exist
    polynomials $P_1, …, P_n$ and polynomials $Q_1, …, Q_m$ such
    that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ A = ⋃_{i = 1}^{n} \Set{x ∈ 𝗥^n}{P_i(x) = 0} ∪ ⋃_{j =
        1}^{m} \Set{x ∈ 𝗥^{n}}{Q_j(x) ≤ 0} ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ In other words, a semialgebraic set can be written as a
    finite union of sets defined by polynomial equalities and
    inequalities. ⦉
