§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The real polynomials are differentiable on all of $𝗥$, and
    have simple derivatives. ⦉
⦉

§ Results ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Suppose $p: 𝗥 → 𝗥$ is a real polynomial with coefficients
    $c_0, …, c_1, …, c_m$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $p$ is differentiable and its derivative $p': 𝗥 → 𝗥$
    satisfies
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ p'(x) = c_1 + 2c_2x + 3c_3x^2 + ⋯ + mc_nx^{m-1} ⦉
