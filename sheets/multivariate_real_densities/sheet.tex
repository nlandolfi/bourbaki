\ssection{Definition}

A \ct{multivariate density}{}
or \ct{joint density}{} is a
function from $n$-dimensional
real space to the real numbers
which is nonnegative and
and normalized.
A real-valued function on $n$-dimensional
real space
is \ct{normalized}{} if it integrates
to 1.

\ssection{Notation}

$f: \R^d \to \R$ with $f \geq 0$ and
$\int f = 1$ is a density.
