\section*{Definition}

A \t{multivariate density} or \t{joint density} is a function from $n$-dimensional real space to the real numbers which is nonnegative and and normalized.
A real-valued function on $n$-dimensional real space is \t{normalized} if it integrates to 1.

\subsection*{Notation}

$f: \R ^d \to \R $ with $f \geq 0$ and $\int f = 1$ is a density.
