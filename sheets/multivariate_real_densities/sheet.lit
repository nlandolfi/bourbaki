§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬multivariate density❭ or ❬joint density❭ is a function
    from $n$-dimensional real space to the real numbers which is
    nonnegative and and normalized. ⦉

  ‖ A real-valued function on $n$-dimensional real space is
    ❬normalized❭ if it integrates to 1. ⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ $f: 𝗥^d → 𝗥$ with $f ≥ 0$ and $∫f = 1$ is a density. ⦉
