\ssection{Why}

We provide a principle for density selection based on maximizing the probability of the dataset.

\ssection{Definition}

Let $(x^1, \dots, x^n)$ be a dataset in $\R^d$.
The \t{density likelihood} for this dataset is
\[
  \product_{k = 1}^{n} f(x^k).
\]
A \t{maximum likelihood density} is a density which maximizes the density likelihood among all densities.
A \t{maximum likelihood density selector} is a density selector that associates a dataset with a maximum likelihood density.

% \[
%   \maximization{f \text{ a density}}{\product_{k = 1}^{n} f(x^k)}
% \]
% We call a solution of the above problem a \t{maximum likelihood density}.
% We call the objective of the above problem \t{density likelihood}.
