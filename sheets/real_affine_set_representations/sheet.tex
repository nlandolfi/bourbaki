\section*{Why}

Since every affine set is a translate of a unique subspace, we can rrepresent them by representing the vector and the subspace.

\section*{Definition}

Recall that $M$ is affine means $M = S + a$ for some subspace $S$ and vector $a \in \R ^n$.
The dimension of $M$ is the dimension of the subspace.
Suppose $\dim S = k$, then there exists $Q \in \R ^{n \times k}$ with $Q^\top  Q = I$, so that for any $x \in S$, there exists unique $z \in \R ^k$ with $x = Qz$.
Since $M = S + a$, we have
  \[
M = \Set{y \in \R ^n}{(\exists z \in \R ^k)(y = a + Qz)}
  \]
We also denote this set $\Set{a + Qz}{z \in \R ^k}$.
