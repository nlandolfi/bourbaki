§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Since every affine set is a translate of a unique subspace,
    we can represent them by representing the vector and the
    subspace. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Recall that $M$ is affine means $M = S + a$ for some
    subspace $S$ and vector $a ∈ 𝗥^n$. ⦉

  ‖ The dimension of $M$ is the dimension of the subspace. ⦉

  ‖ Suppose $\dim S = k$, then there exists $Q ∈ 𝗥^{n × k}$
    with $Q^⊤ Q = I$, so that for any $x ∈ S$, there exists
    unique $z ∈ 𝗥^k$ with $x = Qz$. ⦉

  ‖ Since $M = S + a$, we have
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ M = \Set{y ∈ 𝗥^n}{(∃z ∈ 𝗥^k)(y = a + Qz)} ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ We also denote this set $\Set{a + Qz}{z ∈ 𝗥^k}$. ⦉
