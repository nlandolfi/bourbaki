\section*{Why}

We speak of a set of elements of a metric space which are all within some distance of a fixed point.

\section*{Definition}

The inspiration is the notion of a \sheetref{real_balls}{solid ball}in three-dimensional space.

Consider a metric space and an element of the base set.
The \t{metric ball} of radius $r$ centered at the element is the set of all elements which are less than $r$-distance from the element.

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $(A, d)$ be a metric space.
Let $a \in A$.
Let $r$ be a real number.
Then the ball centered at $a$ of radius $r$ is
\[
\Set*{b \in A}{d(a, b) < r}.
\]
We denote the ball centered at $a$ of radius $r$ by $B(a, r)$.
