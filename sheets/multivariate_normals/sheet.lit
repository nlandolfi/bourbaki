⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We generalize the normal density ⦉

  ‖ to $d$-dimensional space. ⦉

  ‖ \ssection{Definition} ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $f: 𝗥^d → 𝗥$ be a density such that $$f(x) =
    \mgaussiandensity{x}{μ}{Σ}$$ where $μ ∈ 𝗥^d$, $Σ ∈ \SymMat{d}$,
    and $Σ ≻ 0$. ⦉

  ‖ We call $f$ a ❬multivariate normal density❭. ⦉

  ‖ A multivariate normal density with $d = 1$ is a normal
    density, so we refer to multivariate normal densities as
    ❬normal densities❭ without ambiguity. ⦉

  ‖ We frequently use the word normal as a substantive, and
    refer to ❬normals❭ when we mean multivariate normal densities. ⦉

  ‖ Many people call a multivariate normal distribution a
    ❬multivariate gaussian distribution❭ and speak of ❬gaussians❭
    instead of normals.
    † ⦊
      ‖ We avoid this usage in accordance with the project’s
        policy on historical names. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We call $μ$ the ❬mean❭ and $Σ$ the ❬covariance matrix❭. ⦉

  ‖ We call $Σ^{-1}$ the ❬precision matrix❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ \ssection{Maximum} ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The maximum of a normal density is its mean, $μ ∈ 𝗥^d$. ⦉
