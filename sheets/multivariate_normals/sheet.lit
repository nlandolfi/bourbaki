§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We generalize the normal density to $d$-dimensional space. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $f: 𝗥^d → 𝗥$ be a density such that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ f(x) = \mgaussiandensity{x}{μ}{Σ} ⦉
    ⦉
    where $μ ∈ 𝗥^d$, $Σ ∈ 𝗦^d$, and $Σ ≻ 0$. ⦉

  ‖ We call $f$ a ❬multivariate normal density❭. ⦉

  ‖ A multivariate normal density with $d = 1$ is a normal
    density, so we refer to multivariate normal densities as
    ❬normal densities❭ without ambiguity. ⦉

  ‖ We frequently use the word normal as a substantive, and
    refer to ❬normals❭ when we mean multivariate normal densities. ⦉

  ‖ Many people call a multivariate normal distribution a
    ❬multivariate gaussian distribution❭ and speak of ❬gaussians❭
    instead of normals.
    † ⦊
      ‖ We avoid this usage in accordance with the project’s
        policy on historical names. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We call $μ$ the ❬mean❭ and $Σ$ the ❬covariance matrix❭. ⦉

  ‖ We call $Σ^{-1}$ the ❬precision matrix❭. ⦉
⦉

§ Maximum ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The maximum of a normal density is its mean, $μ ∈ 𝗥^d$. ⦉
