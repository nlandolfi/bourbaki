§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to define area under an extended real function. ⦉

  ‖ We use the infinite process to approximate the area under a
    nonnegative extended real function using simple functions. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Consider a measure space. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬integral❭ of a measurable nonnegative function is the
    supremum of integrals over nonnegative simple functions
    pointwise less than or equal to the function. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ be a measure space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $f: X → [0, ∞]$ be measurable. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the integral of $f$ with respect to the measure
    $μ$ by $∫f d μ$. ⦉

  ‖ We defined:
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ ∫f dμ = \sup \Set*{∫g d μ}{g ∈ \SimpleF_+(X) \text{ and
        } g ≤ f}. ⦉
