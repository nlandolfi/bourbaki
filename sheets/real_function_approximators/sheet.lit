§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Since the function space $𝗥 → 𝗥$ is a vector space, can
    we approximate a “complex” element of this set by some basis
    of “simpler” functions in $𝗥 → 𝗥$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Of course, there may be no set that can represent $f$. ⦉

  ‖ So instead we may be interested in an element $g ∈
    \span\set{g_1, …, g_d}$ which approximates $f$.

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬real function approximator❭ for a function $f: 𝗥 → 𝗥$
    is a function $g: 𝗥 → 𝗥$. ⦉
