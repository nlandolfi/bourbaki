§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬scalar multiple❭ of a subset of a vector space ❬by❭ a
    given scalar is the set of all vectors which are the scalar
    product of the given scalar and the vector. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬symmetric reflection❭ of a subset of a vector space is
    the scalar multiple by the additive inverse of the field. ⦉

  ‖ A subset of a vector space is ❬symmetric❭ if it is its
    own symmetric reflection. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(V, 𝗙)$ be a vector space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $M ⊂ V$ and $λ ∈ 𝗙$. ⦉

  ‖ The scalar multiple of $M$ by $λ$ is the set
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \Set*{λ x}{x ∈ M}, ⦉
    ⦉
    which we denote by $λ M$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The symmetric refletion of $M$ is $(-1)M$ which we denote
    by $-M$. ⦉

  ‖ $M$ is symmetric if $M = -M$. ⦉
