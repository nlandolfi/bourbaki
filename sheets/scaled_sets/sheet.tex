\section*{Definition}

The \t{scalar multiple} of a subset of a vector space \t{by} a given scalar is the set of all vectors which are the scalar product of the given scalar and the vector.

The \t{symmetric reflection} of a subset of a vector space is the scalar multiple by the additive inverse of the field.
A subset of a vector space is \t{symmetric} if it is its own symmetric reflection.

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $(V, \F )$ be a vector space.
Let $M \subset V$ and $\lambda  \in \F $.
The scalar multiple of $M$ by $\lambda $ is the set
\[
\Set*{\lambda  x}{x \in M},
\]
which we denote by $\lambda  M$.

The symmetric refletion of $M$ is $(-1)M$ which we denote by $-M$.
$M$ is symmetric if $M = -M$.
