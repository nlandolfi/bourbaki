§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Take a vector space, and consider the set of continuous
    linear functionals on that space. ⦉

  ‖ Given a suitable norm, this space is a complete normed
    space. ⦉
⦉

§ Defining result ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Let $(V, \norm{·})$ be a normed space. ⦉

  ‖ The set $\dual{V}$ of all continuous linear functionals on
    $V$ is a complete normed space with respect to pointwise
    algebraic operations and norm $\dnorm{·}: V → 𝗥$ defined by

    <!--don't use normal { .. | .. } notation because we
        have |F(x)| before the | -->
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \dnorm{F} = \underset{x ∈ V, \;\norm{x} ≤ 1}{\sup}
        \abs{F(x)}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
</statement>
<proof>
  ‖ We argue (1) $\dual{V}$ is a vector space, (2) $\dnorm{·}$
    is a norm, and (3) $(V, \dnorm{·})$ is complete.

</proof>
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We call $(\dual{V}, \dnorm{·})$ the ❬dual space❭ (or
    ❬conjugate dual❭, or ❬Banach dual of $V$❭ ). ⦉

  ‖ Notice that $(\dual{V}, \dnorm{·})$ is complete regardless of
    whether the original normed space $(V,\norm{·})$ is complete. ⦉
⦉

§§ Basic dual norm property ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Notice that the dual norm satisfies a familiar property. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ For any vector $x$ in a normed space $(V, \norm{·})$ and
    any continuous linear functional $F$ on $E$,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \abs{F(x)} ≤ \dnorm{F}\norm{x}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
</statement>
<proof>
  ‖ If $x = 0$, then $\norm{x} = 0$ and $F(x) = 0$ ($F$ is
    linear). Otherwise, $x/\norm{x}$ is a unit vector and so
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \dnorm{F} ≥ \abs{F(x/\norm{x})} = \frac{\abs{F(x)}}{\norm{x}}. ⦉
    ⦉
    where the inequality is from the definition of $\dnorm{·}$
    (as a supremum) and the equality follows from the linearity
    of $F$. ⦉
