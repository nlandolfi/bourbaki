\ssection{Why}

Take a vector space, and consider the set of continuous linear functionals on that space.
Given a suitable norm, this space is a complete normed space.

\ssection{Defining result}

\begin{proposition}
	Let $(V, \norm{\cdot})$ be a normed space.
	The set $\dual{V}$ of all continuous linear functionals on $V$ is a complete normed space with respect to pointwise algebraic operations and norm $\dnorm{\cdot}: V \to \R$ defined by
	\[
		d\norm{F} = \underset{x \in V, \;\norm{x} \leq 1}{\sup} \abs{F(x)}.
	\]
	\begin{proof}
	We argue (1) $\dual{V}$ is a vector space,  (2) $\dnorm{\cdot}$ is a norm, and (3) $(V, \dnorm{\cdot})$ is complete.\footnote{Future editions will include an account.}		
	\end{proof}
\end{proposition}

We call $(\dual{V}, \normm{\cdot})$ the \t{dual space} (or \t{Banach dual of $V$}).
Notice that $(\dual{V}, \normm{\cdot})$ is complete regardless of whether the original vector space $V$ is complete.

\ssubsection{Basic dual norm property}

Notice that the dual norm satisfies a familiar property.

\begin{proposition}
	For any vector $x$ in a normed space $(V, \norm{\cdot})$ and any continuous linear functional $F$ on $E$,
	\[
		\abs{F(x)} \leq \dnorm{F}\norm{x}.
	\]
	\begin{proof}
		If $x = 0$, then $\norm{x} = 0$ and $F(x) = 0$ ($F$ is linear). Otherwise, $x/\norm{x}$ is a unit vector and so
		\[
			\dnorm{F} \geq \abs{F(x/\norm{x})} = \frac{\abs{F(x)}}{\norm{x}}.
		\]
		where the inequality is from the definition of $\dnorm{\cdot}$ (as a supremum) and the equality follows from the linearity of $F$.
	\end{proof}
\end{proposition}
