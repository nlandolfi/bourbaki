\section*{Why}

We can always work with complete metric spaces.

The justification is that we can always, given an incomplete metric space, construct a larger metric space which contains a subset isomorphic to the original one.

\section*{Result}

\begin{proposition}
Let $(A, d)$ be an incomplete metric space.
There exists a complete metric space $(B, d')$ with $C \subset B$ such that $(A, d)$ and $(C, d')$ are isometric and the image under the isometry of $C$ is dense in $B$.
\end{proposition}
