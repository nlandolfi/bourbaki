§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want a density that is symmetric about some center value
    with some spread. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉

<!-- A normal density is one which can be written as a normalized -->
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $f: 𝗥 → 𝗥$ be a density. ⦉

  ‖ If there exists $μ ∈ 𝗥$ and $σ ∈ 𝗥$ with $σ > 0$ so
    that for each $x ∈ 𝗥$
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ f(x) = \normaldensity{x}{μ}{σ} ⦉
    ⦉
    then $f$ is a ❬normal density❭. ⦉

  ‖ A normal density is often called a ❬Gaussian density❭.
    † ⦊
      ‖ We do not use this term in accordance with the Bourbaki
        project's policy on historical names. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ We often drop the word density and use refer to these as
    ❬normals❭ or ❬Gaussians❭, using these words as substantives. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We call the special case when $μ = 0$ and $σ = 1$ the
    ❬standard normal density❭ or ❬standard gaussian density❭. ⦉
⦉

§ Maximum ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The maximum of a normal density is $μ$. ⦉
