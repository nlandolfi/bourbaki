\ssection{Why}

We want a density that is symmetric about some central value with some spread.

\ssection{Definition}

A normal density is one which can be written as a normalized

Let $f: \R \to \R$ be a density.
If there exists $\mu \in \R$ and $\sigma \in \R$ with $\sigma > 0$ so that for each $x \in \R$
\[
  f(x) = \normaldensity{x}{\mu}{\sigma}
\]
then $f$ is a \t{normal density}.
