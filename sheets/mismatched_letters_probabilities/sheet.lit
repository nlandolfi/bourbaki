§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Here’s a nice (surprising) example of computing an event
    probability. ⦉

  ‖ Consider the following question: ⦉

  ‖ We have $n$ letters to put into $n$ addressed envelopes,
    but we ‹randomly› put them into envelopes. ⦉

  ‖ What’s the chance that no letter is in the correct envelope? ⦉
