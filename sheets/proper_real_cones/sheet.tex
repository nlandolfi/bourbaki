\section*{Definition}

A cone $K \subset \R ^n$ is \t{proper} if it is (a) convex, (b) closed, (c) solid, and (d) pointed.
A cone is solid if its interior is nonempty.
A cone is \t{pointed} if it contains no line.
\[
x \in K, -x \in K \Rightarrow x = 0.
\]
In this case, we call $K$ \t{proper cone}.

\subsection*{Example}

The nonnegative orthant is a proper cone.
