§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A measurable ⦉

  ‖ function from ⦉

  ‖ a first measure space ⦉

  ‖ to a second measurable space ⦉

  ‖ induces a measure ⦉

  ‖ on the latter. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Consider two measurable spaces and a measurable function
    between them. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬image measure❭ of a measure on the first space ❬under❭
    the measurable function is the measure on the second space
    which assigns to each measurable set (of that space) the
    measure of the inverse image of that set. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We say that the function ❬induces❭ the image measure on the
    codomain. ⦉

  ‖ Alternatively, we say that we ❬push forward❭ the measure to
    the codomain, and so call the image measure a ❬push forward
    measure❭. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let ⦉

  ‖ $(X, 𝒜)$ ⦉

  ‖ and ⦉

  ‖ $(Y, ℬ)$ ⦉

  ‖ be two measurable spaces. ⦉

  ‖ Let $f: X → Y$ be ⦉

  ‖ a measurable function. ⦉

  ‖ Let ⦉

  ‖ $μ: 𝒜 → \nneri$ ⦉

  ‖ be a measure. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the ⦉

  ‖ image measure of $μ$ ⦉

  ‖ under $f$ by ⦉

  ‖ $\pushforward{μ}{f}$, ⦉

  ‖ for the reason that it
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \pushforward{μ}{f}(B) = μ(f^{-1}(B)) ⦉
    ⦉
    for every $B ∈ ℬ$. ⦉
⦉

§ Change of variables ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The main property ⦉

  ‖ we would like to hold ⦉

  ‖ is that integration ⦉

  ‖ on the new measure space ⦉

  ‖ is the same as integration ⦉

  ‖ on the old. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜)$ and $(Y, ℬ)$ be measurable spaces. ⦉

  ‖ Let $f: X → Y$ be a measurable function and let $μ: 𝒜 →
    \nneri$ be a measure. ⦉
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Then $g: Y → $ is integrable with respect to
      $\pushforward{μ}{f}$ if and only if $g ∘ f$ is integrable
      with respect to $μ$. ⦉

    ‖ In this case,
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ ∫ g d(\pushforward{μ}{f}) ⦉

        ‖ = ⦉

        ‖ ∫ g ∘ f dμ. ⦉
