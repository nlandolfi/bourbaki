§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We consider the set of predictors from which we select. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒳, μ)$ and $f: X → Y$ be probabilistic
    data-generation model. ⦉

  ‖ A ❬hypothesis class❭ $ℋ ⊂ (X → Y)$ is a subset of
    measurable functions. ⦉

  ‖ For a dataset $D ∈ (X × Y)^n$, a ❬restricted empirical
    error minimizer❭ of $ℋ$ is a hypothesis $h ∈ ℋ$ with
    minimal (among elements of $ℋ$) empirical error on $D$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Inductive bias ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Many authorities call the hypothesis class a ❬inductive bias❭
    and speak of “biasing” the “learning algorithm”. ⦉

  ‖ Since one specifies the hypothesis class prior to the data
    it often said to “encode prior knowledge about the problem
    to be learned.” ⦉
⦉

§ Realizable classes ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Some hypothesis classes are better than others. ⦉

  ‖ For example, a hypothesis class that includes the correct
    labeling function seems preferable to a class that does not. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We formulate a weaker condition that captures the case when
    $f ∈ ℋ$. ⦉

  ‖ A hypothesis class $ℋ$ is ❬realizable❭ if there exists
    $h^{★} ∈ ℋ$ with
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ μ(\Set{x ∈ X}{h^★(x) ≠ f(x)}) = 0.% ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ This condition is natural because if $f ∈ ℋ$, then $ℋ$ is
    realizable. ⦉

  ‖ Moreover, the condition has two natural corollaries ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ First, there exists $h^★$ so that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ μ^n(\Set*{x ∈ X^n}{\num{\Set*{i ∈ [n]}{h^★(x_i) ≠ f(x_i)}}
        ≠ 0}) = 0. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ We interpret this as follows: “there exists a hypothesis
    whose probability of achieving nonzero empirical risk is zero.” ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Second, denote by $M_x$ the empirical risk minimizers of $x
    ∈ X^n$. ⦉

  ‖ Then,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ μ^n(\Set*{x ∈ X^n}{∀ h ∈ M_x, ∀ i, h(x_i) = f(x_i)}) =
        1. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ We interpret this as follows: “all empirical risk minimizers
    will achieve zero empirical risk on the dataset, with
    probability 1.” ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Roughly speaking, there exists a hypothesis for which the
    event that it achieves zero empirical risk has probability
    one. ⦉

  ‖ In this event, every hypothesis in the set of empirical
    risk minimizers must achieve zero empirical risk. ⦉

  ‖ This is a consequence of the hypothesis class being
    realizable. ⦉
