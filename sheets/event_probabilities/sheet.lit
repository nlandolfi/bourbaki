⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Since one and only one outcome occurs, given a distribution
    on outcomes, we define the probability of a set of outcomes
    as the sum of their probabilities. ⦉

  ‖ \ssection{Definition} ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given a distribution $p: Ω → 𝗥$, the ❬probability of an
    event❭ $A ⊂ Ω$ is $∑_{a ∈ A} p(a)$, the sum of
    probabilities of its outcomes. ⦉

    measure❭) of (or induced by) $p$. ⦉

  ‖ Define $p: \set{1, …, 6} → 𝗥$ by $p(ω) = \nicefrac{1}{6}$
    for $ω = 1, …, 6$. ⦉

  ‖ Define the event $E = \set{2, 4, 6}$. ⦉

      ‖ 𝗣(E) = ∑_{ω ∈ E} p(ω) = p(2) + p(4) + p(6) =
        \nicefrac{1}{2}. ⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ \ssection{Basic properties} ⦉

  ‖ Notice that for all $A ⊂ Ω$, (i) $𝗣(A) ≥ 0$. ⦉

  ‖ In particular, (ii) $𝗣(Ω) = 1$ (and $𝗣(∅) = 0$). ⦉

  ‖ For all $A, B ⊂ Ω$, $𝗣(A ∪ B) = 𝗣(A) + 𝗣(B) - 𝗣(A ∩
    B)$. ⦉

  ‖ In particular, if $A ∩ B = ∅$, (iii) $𝗣(A ∪ B) = 𝗣(A) +
    𝗣(B)$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Conversely, suppose $f: \powerset{Ω} → 𝗥$ satifies (i), (ii),
    (iii). ⦉

  ‖ These three conditions are sometimes called the ❬axioms of
    probability❭ (for finite sets). ⦉

  ‖ Define $p: Ω → 𝗥$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ p(ω) = f(\set{ω}). ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ In case $f$ satisfies the axioms, $p$ is a probability
    distribution (nonnegative and sums to one). ⦉

  ‖ For this reason we call $f$ satisfying (i)-(iii) an ❬event
    probability function❭ (or ❬probability measure❭). ⦉

  ‖ In the case that we think of a probability event function
    $𝗣$ as induced by a distribution $p$, we write $𝗣_p$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We conclude that $p$ and $𝗣$ are two perspectives. ⦉

  ‖ We can think of elementary events (outcomes) and define
    their probabilities individually in a way that they sum to
    one and are nonnegative. ⦉

  ‖ Or we can think of the compound events, and define their
    probabilities in a way consistent with (i)-(iii). ⦉
