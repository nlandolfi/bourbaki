§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Since one and only one outcome occurs, given a distribution
    on outcomes, we define the probability of a set of outcomes
    as the sum of their probabilities. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given a distribution $p: Ω → 𝗥$, the ❬probability of an
    event❭ $A ⊂ Ω$ is $∑_{a ∈ A} p(a)$, the sum of the
    probabilities of its outcomes. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Define $𝗣: \powerset{Ω} → 𝗥$ by $𝗣(A) = ∑_{a ∈ A} p(a)$. ⦉

  ‖ We call $𝗣$ ❬the event probability function❭ (or ❬the
    probability measure❭) induced by $p$. ⦉

  ‖ Clearly $𝗣$ depends on the set of outcomes $Ω$ and the
    distribution $p: Ω → 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ We sometimes denote this dependence by $𝗣_{Ω, p}$ or $𝗣_p$. ⦉
⦉

§ Example: die ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Define $p: \set{1, …, 6} → 𝗥$ by $p(ω) = \nicefrac{1}{6}$
    for $ω = 1, …, 6$. ⦉

  ‖ Define the event $E = \set{2, 4, 6}$. ⦉

  ‖ Then
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \textstyle ⦉

      ‖ 𝗣(E) = ∑_{ω ∈ E} p(ω) = p(2) + p(4) + p(6) =
        \nicefrac{1}{2}. ⦉

§ Properties of $𝗣$ ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ As a result of the conditions on $p$, $𝗣$ satisfies
    𝍫 ⦊
      ‣ $𝗣(A) ≥ 0$ for all $A ⊂ Ω$; ⦉

      ‣ $𝗣(Ω) = 1$ (and $𝗣(∅) = 0$); ⦉

      ‣ ‖ $𝗣(A) + 𝗣(B)$ for all $A, B ⊂ Ω$ and $A ∩ B = ∅$. ⦉

        ‖ This statement follows from the more general identity
          ◇ ⦊
            ‖ 𝗣(A ∪ B) = 𝗣(A) + 𝗣(B) - 𝗣(A ∩ B) ⦉
          ⦉
          for $A, B ⊂ Ω$, by using $P(∅) = 0$ of (2) above. ⦉⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Do all such $𝗣$ satisfying (1)-(3) have a corresponding
    underlying probability distribution? ⦉

  ‖ In other words, suppose $f: \powerset{Ω} → 𝗥$ satifies
    (1)-(3). ⦉

  ‖ These three conditions are sometimes called the ❬axioms of
    probability for finite sets❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Define $q: Ω → 𝗥$ by $q(ω) = f(\set{ω})$. ⦉

  ‖ If $f$ satisfies the axioms, then $q$ is a probability
    distribution. ⦉

  ‖ For this reason we call any function satisfying (i)-(iii) an
    ❬event probability function❭ (or a ❬probability measure❭). ⦉
⦉


§ Probability by cases ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $𝗣$ be a probability event function. ⦉

  ‖ Suppose $A_1, …, A_n$ partition $Ω$. ⦉

  ‖ Then for any $B ⊂ Ω$,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \textstyle ⦉

      ‖ 𝗣(B) = ∑_{i = 1}^{n} 𝗣(A_i ∩ B). ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Some authors call this the ❬law of total probability❭. ⦉
