§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Since one and only one outcome occurs, given a distribution
    on outcomes, we define the probability of a set of outcomes
    as the sum of their probabilities. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $p$ is a distribution on $Ω$. ⦉

  ‖ For any event $A ⊂ Ω$, we call the value $∑_{a ∈ A}
    p(a)$ the ❬event probability❭. ⦉

  ‖ We refer to the probability ‹of› $A$. ⦉

  ‖ The probability of $A$ is the sum of the probabilities of
    its outcomes. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We can define a function $𝗣: \powerset{Ω} → 𝗥$ by $𝗣(A) =
    ∑_{a ∈ A} p(a)$. ⦉

  ‖ We call $𝗣$ ❬the event probability function❭ (or ❬the
    probability measure❭) induced by $p$. ⦉

  ‖ Since $𝗣$ depends on the sample space $Ω$ and the
    distribution $p$, we ocassionally denote this dependence by
    $𝗣_{Ω, p}$ or $𝗣_p$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Many authors associate an event $A ⊂ Ω$ with a function
    $π: Ω → \set{0, 1}$ so that $A = \Set*{ω ∈ Ω}{π(ω) = 1}$. ⦉

  ‖ In this context, it is common to write $𝗣[π(ω)]$ for $𝗣(A)$. ⦉
⦉

§ Example: die ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Define $p: \set{1, …, 6} → 𝗥$ by $p(ω) = 1/6$ for $ω =
    1, …, 6$. ⦉

  ‖ Define the event $E = \set{2, 4, 6}$. ⦉

  ‖ Then
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \textstyle ⦉

      ‖ 𝗣(E) = ∑_{ω ∈ E} p(ω) = p(2) + p(4) + p(6) = 1/2. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

§ Properties of $𝗣$ ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ As a result of the conditions on $p$, $𝗣$ satisfies
    𝍫 ⦊
      ‣ $𝗣(A) ≥ 0$ for all $A ⊂ Ω$; ⦉

      ‣ $𝗣(Ω) = 1$ (and $𝗣(∅) = 0$); ⦉

      ‣ ‖ $𝗣(A) + 𝗣(B)$ for all $A, B ⊂ Ω$ and $A ∩ B = ∅$. ⦉

        ‖ This statement follows from the more general identity
          ◇ ⦊
            ‖ 𝗣(A ∪ B) = 𝗣(A) + 𝗣(B) - 𝗣(A ∩ B) ⦉
          ⦉
          for $A, B ⊂ Ω$, by using $𝗣(∅) = 0$ of (2) above. ⦉⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ These three conditions are sometimes called the ❬axioms of
    probability for finite sets❭. ⦉

  ‖ Do all such $𝗣$ satisfying (1)-(3) have a corresponding
    underlying probability distribution? ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ In other words, suppose $f: \powerset{Ω} → 𝗥$ satifies
    (1)-(3). ⦉

  ‖ Define $q: Ω → 𝗥$ by $q(ω) = f(\set{ω})$. ⦉

  ‖ If $f$ satisfies the axioms, then $q$ is a probability
    distribution. ⦉

  ‖ For this reason we call any function satisfying (i)-(iii) an
    ❬event probability function❭ (or a ❬(finite) probability
    measure❭). ⦉
⦉

§ Other basic consequences ⦉

§§ Probability by cases ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $𝗣$ be a probability event function. ⦉

  ‖ Suppose $A_1, …, A_n$ partition $Ω$. ⦉

  ‖ Then for any $B ⊂ Ω$,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \textstyle ⦉

      ‖ 𝗣(B) = ∑_{i = 1}^{n} 𝗣(A_i ∩ B). ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Some authors call this the ❬law of total probability❭. ⦉
⦉

§§ Monotonicity ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ If $A ⊆ B$, then $𝗣(A) ≤ P(B)$. ⦉

  ‖ This is easy to see by splitting $B$ into $A ∩ B$ and $B
    \setminus A$, and applying (1) and (3). ⦉
⦉

§§ Subadditivity ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ For $A, B ⊂ Ω$, $𝗣(A ∪ B) ≤ 𝗣(A) + 𝗣(B)$. ⦉

  ‖ This is easy to see from the more general identity in (3)
    above. ⦉

  ‖ This is sometimes referred to as a ❬union bound❭, in
    reference to ‹bounding› the quantity $𝗣(A ∪ B)$. ⦉
