⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ If we have some outcomes and a distribution, we can
    construct a function which assigns probabilities to events. ⦉

⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬probability of an event❭ is the sum of the
    probabilities of the outcomes in the event. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬event probability function❭ is the correspondence
    assigning events to their probabilities. ⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A$ be a set of outcomes and $p$ a distribution on
    $A$. ⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The event probability function $\PE$ depends on the outcomes
    $A$ and the distribution $p$. ⦉

  ‖ We sometimes indicate this dependence by writing $\PE_{A, p}$. ⦉
