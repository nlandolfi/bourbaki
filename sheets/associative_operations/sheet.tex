\ssection{Why}

We name operations for which
we the first two or the second
two elements in an ordered list
of three elements.

\ssection{Definition}


An operation \ct{associates}{associates}
if given any three elements in order it
doesn't matter whether we first operate
on the first two and then with the result
of the first two the third, or the second
two and with the result of the second two
the first.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $A$ be a non-empty set and let $+: A \times A \to A$
be an operation.
If $+$ associates, then
$$
  (a + b) + c = (a + b) + c
$$
for all $a, b, c \in A$.
