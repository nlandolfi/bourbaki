§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ In the case that it is not possible to easily identify (or
    guess) the limit of a sequence, we are naturally interested
    in a simple condition on the sequence which is equivalent to
    convergence. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A sequence $(x_n)_{n ∈ 𝗡}$ in $𝗥$ is said to be ❬egopox❭
    (or ❬Cauchy❭ or a ❬Cauchy sequence❭) if for every $ϵ > 0$,
    there exists $N ∈ 𝗡$ so that for all $m, n > N$,
    $\abs{x_m - x_n} < ϵ$. ⦉

  ‖ We call this property of the sequence ❬(eventual)
    egoproximity❭. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We sometimes denote this property as
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \abs{x_n - x_m} → 0 \quad \text{ as } \quad m, n → ∞. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

§§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ For example, consider $\lim_{N → ∞} ∑_{n = 1}^{N} 1∕n^3$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Sufficiency in $𝗥$ ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Clearly a convergent sequence is egoprox.

    ⦉⦉

  ‖ What of the converse? ⦉

  ‖ Recall that we think of egoprox sequences as “bunching up.} ⦉

  ‖ For the reals, if a sequence is bunching up, then our
    intuition is that it should be converging. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, an egoprox real sequence always converges. ⦉

  ‖ The egoprox condition is sufficient. ⦉

  ‖ Bunching up is sufficient. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ If $(x_n)_{n ∈ 𝗡}$ is egoprox, then there exists $x_0 ∈ 𝗥$
    so that $\lim_{n → ∞} x_n = x_0$. ⦉
</statement>
¶ ⦊
  ‖ In other words, in $𝗥$ egoproximity is equivalent to
    convergence. ⦉

  ‖ The above is sometimes called the ❬Bolzano-Weierstrass
    theorem❭. ⦉
