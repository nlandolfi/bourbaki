\ssection{Why}

In the case that it is not possible to easily identify (or guess) the limit of a sequence, we may be interested in other conditions on the sequence which is equivalent to convergence.

\ssection{Definition}

A sequence $(x_n)_{n \in \N}$ in $\R$ is said to be \t{egopox} (or \t{Cauchy} or a \t{Cauchy sequence}) if for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $N \in \N$ so that for all $m, n > N$,
\[
  \abs{x_m - x_n} < \epsilon
\]

\ssection{Notation}

We sometimes denote this property as
\[
    \abs{x_n - x_m} \to 0 \quad \text{ as } \quad m, n \to \infty.
\]
