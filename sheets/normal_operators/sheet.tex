\section*{Why}

We can abstract the property of self-adjointness.

\section*{Definition}

An operator $T$ oon an inner product space is called \t{normal} if if commutes with its adjoints.
In symbols, $T \in \mathcal{L} (V)$ is normal if
\[
TT^* = T^* T
\]

\begin{proposition}
Every self-adjoint operator is normal.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L} (V)$ with $T^* = T$.
Then $TT^* = TT = T^*T$, and so $T$ is normal.\end{proof}
