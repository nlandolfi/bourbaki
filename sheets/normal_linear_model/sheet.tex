\ssection{Why}

\ssection{Definition}

The \t{normal linear model} is a linear model in which the signal and noise are assumed to have normal (Gaussian) densities.

Let $(\Omega, \CA, \PM)$ be a probability space.
Let $x: \Omega \to \R^d$ and $e: \Omega \to \R^d$ be independent \textit{normal} random vectors with zero mean and covariances $\Sigma_{x}$ and $\Sigma_e$.
Let $y = Ax + e$.
