§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ If we interpret a list of two numbers as displacement in a
    plane, and a list of three numbers as displacement in a
    space, what of a list of $n$ numbers as displacement in
    $𝗥^n$? ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬real vector❭ (or ❬vector❭, ❬$n$-dimensional vector❭,
    ❬$n$-vector❭) is a length-$n$ list of real numbers. ⦉
⦉

§ Algebra ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ For $x, y ∈ 𝗥^n$, we define the ❬real vector sum❭ (or
    ❬sum❭) of $x$ and $y$ as the vector $z ∈ 𝗥^n$ where $z_i
    = x_i + y_i$ for $i = 1, …, n$. ⦉

  ‖ As usual, we denote the sum by $x+y$, so
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ x + y = (x_1 +y_1, …, x_n + y_n). ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ For $α ∈ 𝗥$ and $x ∈ 𝗥^n$, ❬real scalar-vector product❭
    (or ❬scalar product❭, ❬product❭) $z ∈ 𝗥^{n}$ is defined by
    $z_i = α x_i$ for $i = 1, …, n$. ⦉

  ‖ As usual, we denote the product $α x$, and write
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ α x = (α x_1, …, α x_n). ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Our intuition for both of these ‹operations› comes from
    their special cases in $𝗥^2$ and $𝗥^3$. ⦉

  ‖ As usual, the ❬real-vector difference❭ (or ❬difference❭) of
    $x$ and $y$ is the vector $z ∈ 𝗥^{n}$ defined by $z_i =
    x_i - y_i$ for $i = 1, …, n$. ⦉

  ‖ As usual, we denote it by $x - y$, and note that $x - y
    = x + (-y)$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The algebra given here for vectors is natural in view of
    their generalization as $n$-dimensional ‹displacements›. ⦉

  ‖ However, we keep in mind that this algebra is over lists
    of numbers, and that these sums and products can be defined
    on these lists of numbers regardless of interpretation. ⦉
