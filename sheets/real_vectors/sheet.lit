  ‖ \ssection{Why} ⦉

  ‖ We can think of a list of two numbers as displacement in
    the plane, and a list of three numbers as displacement in
    space. ⦉

  ‖ More generally, we can think of a list of $n$ numbers as
    displacement in $𝗥^n$. ⦉

  ‖ Moreover, we can define algebraic operations on the points
    in $𝗥^n$ which have geometric interpretations. ⦉

  ‖ For $x, y ∈ 𝗥^n$, define $x + y$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ (x_1 +y_1, …, x_n + y_n) ⦉
    ⦉
    and for $α ∈ 𝗥$, define $α \cdot x$

  ‖ \ssubsection{Note on terminology} ⦉

  ‖ The etymology of the word “vector” is from the Latin
    “vector,” meaning, literally, carrier. ⦉

  ‖ This sense is from the interpretation of a vector as
    indicating a displacement.
