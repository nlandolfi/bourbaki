\ssection{Why}

A point in $\R^n$ is also called a vector in $\R^n$, since $R^n$ with the usual operations of element-wise addition and element-wise scalar multiplication is a vector space.

\ssection{Result}

For $x, y \in \R^n$, define $x + y$ by
\[
  (x_1 +y_1, \dots, x_n + y_n)
\]
and for $\alpha \in \R$, define $\alpha \cdot x$
\[
  (\alpha x_1, \dots, \alpha x_n).
\]

\begin{proposition}
  $\R^n$ is a vector space of dimension $n$ over $\R$ with $+$ and $\cdot$.
\end{proposition}

For this reason, we call elements of $\R^n$ \t{(real) vectors}.
