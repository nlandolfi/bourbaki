\ssection{Why}
We can think of a list of two numbers as displacement in the plane, and a list of three numbers as displacement in space.
More generally, we can think of a list of $n$ numbers as displacement in $\R^n$.
Moreover, we can define algebraic operations on the points in $\R^n$ which have geometric interpretations.

\ssection{Definition}
A \t{vector} (\t{real vector}) is a list of real numbers.

\ssection{Result}
For $x, y \in \R^n$, define $x + y$ by
  \[
(x_1 +y_1, \dots, x_n + y_n)
  \]
and for $\alpha \in \R$, define $\alpha \cdot x$
  \[
(\alpha x_1, \dots, \alpha x_n).
  \]

\ssubsection{Note on terminology}
The etymology of the word \say{vector} is from the Latin \say{vector,} meaning, literally, carrier.
This sense is from the interpretation of a vector as indicating a displacement.
