\section*{Why}

If we interpret a list of two numbers as displacement in a plane, and a list of three numbers as displacement in a space, what of a list of $n$ numbers as displacement in $\R ^n$?

\section*{Definition}

A \t{real vector} (\t{vector}, \t{$n$-dimensional vector}, \t{$n$-vector}) is a length-$n$ list of real numbers.

\section*{Algebra}

For $x, y \in \R ^n$, we define the \t{real vector sum} (or \t{sum}) of $x$ and $y$ as the vector $z \in \R ^n$ where $z_i = x_i + y_i$ for $i = 1, \dots , n$.
As usual, we denote the sum by $x+y$, so
    \[
x + y = (x_1 +y_1, \dots , x_n + y_n).
    \]
For $\alpha  \in \R $ and $x \in \R ^n$, \t{real scalar-vector product} (or \t{scalar product}, \t{product}) $z \in \R ^{n}$ is defined by $z_i = \alpha  x_i$ for $i = 1, \dots , n$.
As usual, we denote the product $\alpha  x$, and write
    \[
\alpha  x = (\alpha  x_1, \dots , \alpha  x_n).
    \]

Our intuition for both of these \textit{operations} comes from their special cases in $\R ^2$ and $\R ^3$.
As usual, the \t{real-vector difference} (or \t{difference}) of $x$ and $y$ is the vector $z \in \R ^{n}$ defined by $z_i = x_i - y_i$ for $i = 1, \dots , n$.
As usual, we denote it by $x - y$, and note that $x - y = x + (-y)$.

The algebra given here for vectors is natural in view of their generalization as $n$-dimensional \textit{displacements}.
However, we keep in mind that this algebra is over lists of numbers, and that these sums and products can be defined on these lists of numbers regardless of interpretation.
