§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A sequence of random variables convergences in probability if
    it converges in measure. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ be a measure space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $\seq{f}$ a sequence of real-valued measurable functions
    on $X$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $f: X → R$ be measurable function. ⦉

  ‖ If $f_n$ converges in measure to $f$ we write: $f_n \goesto
    f$ in probability, read aloud as “f n goes to f in
    probability.” ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $f_n \goesto f$ in probability. ⦉

  ‖ Then for every $ϵ > 0$,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \lim_{n → ∞} μ(\Set*{x ∈ X}{\abs{f_n(x) - f(x)} > ϵ}) =
        0. ⦉
