Laws of large numbers.

\section*{Definition}

A sequence of random variables convergences in probability if it converges in measure.

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $(X, \mathcal{A} , \mu )$ be a measure space.
Let $\seq{f}$ a sequence of real-valued measurable functions on $X$.
Let $f: X \to R$ be measurable function.
If $f_n$ converges in measure to $f$ we write: $f_n \goesto f$ in probability, read aloud as \say{f n goes to f in probability.}

Suppose $f_n \goesto f$ in probability.
Then for every $\epsilon  > 0$,
    \[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \mu (\Set*{x \in X}{\abs{f_n(x) - f(x)} > \epsilon }) = 0.
    \]
