§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to talk about sequences of real numbers which, as
    we go further and further in the sequence, get closer and
    closer to some fixed real number. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We need to talk about “where” a sequence is “approaching.” ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬limit❭ of a sequence $(x_n)_{n ∈ 𝗡}$ of real numbers is
    a real number $x_0$ with the property that, for any interval
    centered at $x_0$, we can find a final part of the sequence
    wholly contained in that interval; no matter how small the
    interval. ⦉

  ‖ By making the interval small, we capture the intuition that
    the sequence is “close” to its limit. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ In other words, you propose a limit for a sequence. ⦉

  ‖ To test this proposal, I specify some small positive real
    number. ⦉

  ‖ Then we look for a final part of the sequence which is
    wholly contained in the interval whose width is twice the
    small positive number. ⦉

  ‖ If we can always find the final part, no matter how small
    the positive number I specified, then the proposed limit is
    true. ⦉
⦉

§§ Existence ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Some sequences have no limit. ⦉

  ‖ Consider the sequence which alternates between $+1$ and $-1$. ⦉

  ‖ To show that the limit does not exist, we argue indirectly. ⦉

  ‖ We take any real number and test it with the interval
    length one. ⦉

  ‖ No matter which real number we have selected, $+1$ and $-1$
    are a distance two apart, and so can not both be contained
    in an interval of width one. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ In the case that there exists a limit for a sequence, we
    say that the sequence ❬converges to❭ its limit (or we say
    that it ❬converges❭, or call it ❬convergent❭ or ❬converging❭). ⦉
⦉

§§ Uniqueness ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ If a sequence has a limit, it has only one limit. ⦉

  ‖ So, from here on, we will speak of ❬the limit❭ of the
    sequence. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ To see this uniqueness, suppose that two real numbers
    satisfy the limiting property. ⦉

  ‖ We now argue indirectly: suppose also that they are not
    equal. ⦉

  ‖ Denote the distance between them by $x$. ⦉

  ‖ Then ask for final parts in intervals of width $x/2$ for
    both limits. ⦉
⦉

§§ Approximation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We use limits to speak about the terminating behavior of
    infinite processes. ⦉

  ‖ We think about the sequence as approximating the limit. ⦉

  ‖ The sequence may never actually take the value of its
    limit, so the limit need not be in the set of terms of
    the sequence. ⦉

  ‖ But the idea, of course, is that the set of terms,
    especially those “far out” in the sequence, are close to the
    limit. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The definition, moreover, ensures that the sequence will get
    arbitrarily close. ⦉

  ‖ We can operationalize this property, by taking the first
    element of that final part after which all elements are
    close to the limit. ⦉

  ‖ This element of the sequence approximates the limit value
    well. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $\seq{a}$ be a sequence of real numbers. ⦉

  ‖ Let $a$ be a real number. ⦉

  ‖ We denote that $a$ is the limit of $\seq{a}$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ a = \lim_{n → ∞} a_n. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ The abbreviation “lim” is from the Latin word ‹limes›, which
    means boundary, or limit. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We read this statement aloud as “a is the limit of a sub
    n.” ⦉

  ‖ The above statement asserts two facts: (1) the sequence
    $\seq{a}$ has a limit and (2) the limit is the real number
    $a$. ⦉

  ‖ We sometimes abbreviate this by writing ⦉

  ‖ $a = \lim_{n} a_n$. ⦉
