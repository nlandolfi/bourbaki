\section*{Why}

We want to find a low-dimensional affine set into which we can project some high-dimensional data.

\section*{Problem}

For $a \in \R ^n$ and $U \in \R ^{n \times k}$, the set $W(a, U) = \set{a + Uz}{z \in \R ^n}$ is an affine set.
Denote the projection of $x \in \R ^n$ onto $W(a, U)$ by $\proj_{W(a, U)}(x)$.

Given $x^{(1)}, \dots , x^{(m)} \in \R ^n$, and a dimension $k$, we want to choose $a$ and $U$ to minimize
  \[
\textstyle
\sum_{i = 1}^{m} \norm{x - \proj_{W(a, U)}(x)}^2,
  \]
the sum of squares of the distance from $x$ to its projection in $W(a, U)$.
