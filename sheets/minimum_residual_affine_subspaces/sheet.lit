§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to find a low-dimensional affine set into which we
    can project some high-dimensional data. ⦉
⦉

§ Problem ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ For $a ∈ 𝗥^n$ and $U ∈ 𝗥^{n × k}$, the set $W(a, U) =
    \set{a + Uz}{z ∈ 𝗥^n}$ is an affine set. ⦉

  ‖ Denote the projection of $x ∈ 𝗥^n$ onto $W(a, U)$ by
    $\proj_{W(a, U)}(x)$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given $x^{(1)}, …, x^{(m)} ∈ 𝗥^n$, and a dimension $k$, we
    want to choose $a$ and $U$ to minimize

      ‖ ∑_{i = 1}^{m} \norm{x - \proj_{W(a, U)}(x)}^2, ⦉
    ⦉
    the sum of squares of the distance from $x$ to its
    projection in $W(a, U)$. ⦉
