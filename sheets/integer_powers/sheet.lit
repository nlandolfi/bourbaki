§ Why ⦉
† ⦊
  ‖ Future editions will include. This sheet include only a very
    basic outline of a few definitions. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $a ∈ 𝗭$ and let $p ∈ 𝗡$. ⦉

  ‖ Define the first power of $a$ to be $a$. ⦉

  ‖ Define the second power of $a$ to be $a^2$. ⦉

  ‖ Define the $p$th power of a for $p ≥ 2$ to be $a^p =
    aa^{p-1}$. ⦉
⦉

§ Negative powers ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $a ∈ 𝗭$ and let $p ∈ 𝗭$ with $p < 0$. ⦉

  ‖ Then define $a^{p}$ to be $1/a^{-p}$. ⦉

  ‖ Since $p$ is negative, $-p$ is positive and so we have
    defined $a^{-p}$. ⦉
⦉

§ Zero ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Define $a^0 = 1$. ⦉
