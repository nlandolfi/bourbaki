\ssection{Why}\footnote{Future editions will include. This sheet include only a very basic outline of a few definitions.}

\ssection{Definition}

Let $a \in \Z$ and let $p \in \N$.
Define the first power of $a$ to be $a$.
Define the second power of $a$ to be $a^2$.
Define the $p$th power of a for $p \geq 2$ to be $a^p = aa^{p-1}$.

\ssection{Negative Powers}

Let $a \in \Z$ and let $p \in \Z$ with $p < 0$.
Then define $a^{p}$ to be $1/a^{-p}$.
Since $p$ is negative, $-p$ is positive and so we have defined $a^{-p}$.

\ssection{Zero}

Define $a^0 = 1$.
