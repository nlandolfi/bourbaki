\ssection{Why}

In general, a dataset may be both incomplete and inconsistent.

\ssection{Why}

Let $(Z, \CZ)$ be a measurable space.
Let $\CM(Z, \CZ)$ be the set of measures over $(Z, \CZ)$.
A \t{probabilistic inductor} for a dataset in $Z^n$ is a function mapping $Z^n$ to $\CM(Z, \CZ)$.

Suppose $(Z, \CZ) = (X \times Y, \CX \times \CY)$ for measurable spaces $(X, \CX)$ and $(Y, \CY)$.
Then a probabilistic inductor yields a probabilistic functional inductor.
The conditional measure on $Y$ given an observation $x \in X$ is exactly a family of measures indexed by $X$.
