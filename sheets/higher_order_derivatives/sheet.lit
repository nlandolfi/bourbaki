§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The second derivative (if it exists) is the derivative of
    the derivative of a function. ⦉

  ‖ Can we continue in this way? ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A ⊂ 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $f: A → 𝗥$ be twice differentiable. ⦉

  ‖ We call $f$ ❬three times differentiable❭ (or ❬thrice
    differentiable❭) if its second derivative is differentiable. ⦉

  ‖ We call the derivative of the second derivative of $f$ the
    ❬third derivative❭ of $f$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ For $n ≥ 3$, we call $f$ ❬$n+1$-times differentiable❭ if
    $f$ is $n$-times differentiable. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬$n+1$th derivative❭ of a $n+1$-times differenetiable
    function is the derivative the $n$th derivative of the
    function. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The $n$th derivative of a function $f: A → 𝗥$ is sometimes
    denoted $f^{(n)}: A → 𝗥$. ⦉
