\ssection{Why}

Many things in real
life are bounded
and linear.
More importantly,
a bounded linear
function between
two norm spaces
is continuous.
We will show this later.

\ssection{Definition}

A \ct{bounded linear function}{}
between two norm spaces is
a linear function which is
bounded.
Bounded linear functions
are sometimes called
\ct{bounded operators}{},
since linear functions are
sometimes called operators.
