§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ What are addition and multiplication for integers? ⦉

  ‖ What are the identity elements? ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We call the operation of forming integer sums ❬integer
    addition❭. ⦉

  ‖ We call the operation of forming integer products ❬integer
    multiplication❭. ⦉
⦉

§ Results ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ It is easy to see the following.

    ⦉⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ The additive identity for $𝗭$ is $\eqc{(0, 0)}$. ⦉
</statement>
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ The multiplicative identity for $𝗭$ is $\eqc{(1, 0)}$. ⦉
</statement>

§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the additive identity of $𝗭$ by $0_{𝗭}$ and the
    multiplicative identity by $1_{𝗭}$. ⦉

  ‖ When it is clear from context, we call $0_{𝗭}$ “zero” and
    we call $1_{𝗭}$ “one”. ⦉
⦉

§ Distributive ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ For integers $x, y, z ∈ 𝗭$, $x · (y + z) = x · y + x
    · z$.
