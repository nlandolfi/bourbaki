\ssection{Why}

What are addition and multiplication for integers?
What are the identity elements?


\ssection{Definition}

We call the operation of forming integer sums \t{integer addition}.
We call the operation of forming integer products \t{integer multiplication}.

\ssection{Results}

It is easy to see the following.\footnote{Nonetheless, the full accounts will appear in future editions.}

\begin{proposition}
  The additive identity for $\Z$ is $\eqc{(0, 0)}$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
  The multiplicative identity for $\Z$ is $\eqc{(0, 0)}$.
\end{proposition}

\ssection{Notation}

We denote teh additive identity of $\Z$ by $0_{\Z}$ and themultiplicative idenity by $1_{\Z}$.
