\section*{Definition}

Given a subset $A$ of a topological space, a point $x$ is said to be \t{in the interior of} $A$ (an \t{interior point of}) if $A$ is a neighborhood of $x$.
The \t{interior} of $A$ is the set of all interior points

\subsection*{Notation}

The interior of a set $A$ of a topological space is denoted by $\Int(A)$.
% <div data-littype='run'> Less frequently the interior is denoted by $AÂ°$. </div> 

Less frequently the interior is denoted by $A^\circ$.
