§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ What are addition and multiplication for rationals? ⦉

  ‖ What are the identity elements? ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We call the operation of forming rationals sums ❬rational
    addition❭. ⦉

  ‖ We call the operation of forming rational products ❬rational
    multiplication❭. ⦉
⦉

§ Results ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ It is easy to see the following.

⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ The additive identity for $𝗤$ is $\eqc{(0_{𝗭}, 1_{𝗭})}$. ⦉
</statement>
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ The multiplicative identity for $𝗭$ is $\eqc{(1_{𝗭}, 1_{𝗭})}$. ⦉
</statement>

§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the additive identity of $𝗤$ by $0_{𝗤}$ and the
    multiplicative identity by $1_{𝗤}$. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the set $\Set{q ∈ 𝗤}{q ≥ 0_{Q}}$ by $𝗤_{+}$. ⦉
⦉

§ Distributive ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ For rationals $x, y, z ∈ 𝗭$, $x · (y + z) = x· y + x·
    z$.
