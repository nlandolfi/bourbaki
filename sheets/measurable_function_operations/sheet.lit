§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Under which operations is the set of measurable functions
    closed? ⦉
⦉

§ Overview ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Measurable functions are closed under composition and
    concatenation. ⦉

  ‖ Taking these facts together with the observation that
    continuous functions are measurable, we conclude that
    measurable functions are closed under addition, multiplication,
    and (with suitable nonzero assumptions) division. ⦉
⦉

§ Results ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ The composition of two ⦉

    ‖ measurable functions ⦉

    ‖ is measurable. ⦉
  ⦉
</statement>
<proof>
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Let ⦉

    ‖ $(X, 𝒜)$, ⦉

    ‖ $(Y, ℬ)$, ⦉

    ‖ $(Z, 𝒞)$ ⦉

    ‖ be measurable spaces. ⦉

    ‖ Let $f: X → Y$ ⦉

    ‖ and $g: Y → Z$ be ⦉

    ‖ measurable functions. ⦉

    ‖ Define $h = g ∘ f$. ⦉
  ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Let $C ∈ 𝒞$. ⦉

    ‖ Measurability of $g$ ⦉

    ‖ implies ⦉

    ‖ $g^{-1}(C) ∈ ℬ$. ⦉

    ‖ This fact, together with ⦉

    ‖ measurability of $f$, ⦉

    ‖ implies ⦉

    ‖ $f^{-1}(g^{-1}(C)) ∈ 𝒜$. ⦉

    ‖ Since $h^{-1} = f^{-1} ∘ g^{-1}$, ⦉

    ‖ we conclude that ⦉

    ‖ $h$ is measurable. ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ A continuous function ⦉

    ‖ between topological ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ The concatentation of ⦉

    ‖ two measurable functions ⦉

    ‖ is measurable. ⦉
  ⦉
</statement>
<proof>
  ‖ Let ⦉

  ‖ $(X, 𝒜)$, ⦉

  ‖ $(Y, ℬ)$ ⦉

  ‖ and ⦉

  ‖ $(Z, 𝒞)$ ⦉

  ‖ be measurable spaces. ⦉

  ‖ Let ⦉

  ‖ $f: X → Y$ ⦉

  ‖ and ⦉

  ‖ $g: X → Z$ ⦉

  ‖ be measurable. ⦉

  ‖ Define ⦉

  ‖ $h: X → Y \cross Z$ ⦉

  ‖ by $h(x) = (f(x), g(x))$. ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜)$ ⦉

    ‖ be a measurable space ⦉

    ‖ and let $R$ denote the ⦉

    ‖ real numbers. ⦉

    ‖ Let ⦉

    ‖ $f,g: X → R$ ⦉

    ‖ be measurable. ⦉
  ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
