\section*{Why}

We generalize trees and discuss an example of chordal graphs.\footnote{Future editions will modify, and may introduce $k$-trees without chordal graphs.}

\section*{Definition}

Let $k \in \N $.
A $k$-tree is defined indirectly.
Let $G = (V, E)$ be a a complete graph and $\nu m{V} = k$.

The complete graph on $
If $
A \t{$k$-tree} is an undirected graph with at least $k$ vertices.
The only $k$-tree with $k$ vertices is the complete graph.

    \section*{Chordality}


\begin{proposition}
All $k$-trees are chordal.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}Induction on $k$-tree with $k$ vertices.
\end{proof}
