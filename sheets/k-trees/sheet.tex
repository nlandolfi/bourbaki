\ssection{Why}

They are an example of a chordal graph.
They generalize trees.

\ssection{Definition}

A \t{$k$-tree} is an undirected graph with at least $k$ vertices.
The only $k$-tree with $k$ vertices is the complete graph.

\ssection{Chordality}

\begin{prop}

All $k$-trees are chordal.

\begin{proof}

  Induction on $k$-tree with $k$ vertices.

\end{proof}

\end{prop}
