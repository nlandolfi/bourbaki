§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We generalize trees and discuss an example of chordal
    graphs.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will modify, and may introduce $k$-trees
        without chordal graphs. ⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $k ∈ 𝗡$. ⦉

  ‖ A $k$-tree is defined indirectly. ⦉

  ‖ Let $G = (V, E)$ be a a complete graph and $νm{V} = k$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The complete graph on $ ⦉

  ‖ If $ ⦉

  ‖ A ❬$k$-tree❭ is an undirected graph with at least $k$
    vertices. ⦉

  ‖ The only $k$-tree with $k$ vertices is the complete graph. ⦉
