\section*{Definition}

The \t{expectation} (or \t{expected value}) of a real-valued random variable defined on a probability space is its integral with respect to the probability measure.
The expectation of a random variable is also called its \t{mean}.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(X, \mathcal{A} , \mu )$ be a probability space and $f: X \to \R $ be a random variable.
We denote the expectation of $f$ by $\E f$, defined:
  \[
\E  f = \int f d\mu .
  \]
