\ssection{Why}

\footnote{Future editions will include this.}

\ssection{Definition}

The \t{expectation} (or \t{expected value}) of a real-valued random variable defined on a probability space is its integral with respect to the probability measure.
The expectation of a random variable is also called its \t{mean}.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(X, \SA, \mu)$ be a probability space and $f: X \to \R$ be a random variable.
We denote the expectation of $f$ by $\Expect f$.
We defined it by
\[
  \Expect f = \int f d\mu.
\]
