§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬basis for❭ a vector space is a set of linearly
    independent vectors whose span is the set of vectors of the
    space. ⦉

  ‖ For any vector in the space, there exists a linear
    combination of the basis vectors whose result is that vector. ⦉

  ‖ In this case, it is common to say that any vector in the
    space “can be written as a linear combination of the basis
    vectors.” ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Since the basis is a linearly independent set, the linear
    combination of basis vectors is unique. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ If we have a basis of $n$ vectors for $(V, 𝗙)$ then each
    vector $v ∈ V$ can be written uniquely as a linear
    combination of the vectors in the basis. ⦉

  ‖ If we take the vector in the field which is these
    coefficients, then this is an isomorphism with the vector
    space $(𝗙^n, 𝗙)$ ⦉

  ‖ We call this the ❬coordinate vector❭. ⦉

§ Characterizations ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ A set of vectors is a basis if and only if no proper
    superset of it is linearly independent. ⦉
</statement>
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ A set of vectors that spans the space is a basis if and
    only if no proper subset of it spans the space. ⦉
