A \t{basis} of a vector space is a set of linearly independent vectors whose span is the set of vectors of the space.


\begin{prop}
  A set of vectors is a basis if and only if no proper superset of it is linearly independent.
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}
  A set of vectors that spans the space is a basis if and only if no proper subset of it spans the space.
\end{prop}

If we have a basis of $n$ vectors for $(V, \F)$ then each vector $v \in V$ can be written uniquely as a linear combination of the vectors in the basis.
If we take the vector in the field which is these coefficients, then this is an isomorphism with the vector space $(\F^n, \F)$
We call this the \t{coordinate vector}.
