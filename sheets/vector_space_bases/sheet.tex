A \t{basis} of a vector space is a set of linearly independent vectors whose span is the set of vectors of the space.


\begin{prop}
  A set of vectors is a basis if and only if no proper superset of it is linearly independent.
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}
  A set of vectors that spans the space is a basis if and only if no proper subset of it spans the space.
\end{prop}
