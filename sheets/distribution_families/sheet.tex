\section*{Definition}

A \t{distribution family} (\t{density family}) on $X$ is a family of distributions (densities) $\set{p^{(\theta )}}_{\theta  \in \Theta }$ on $X$.
% for which $\Theta \subset \R^p$. 

We call the index set $\Theta $ (see \sheetref{families}{Families}) the \t{parameters}.
Frequently $\Theta  \subset \R ^p$ where $p \in \N  $.

Similarly, a \t{conditional distribution family} (\t{conditional density family}) on $Z$ from $X$ is a family $\set{q^{(\theta )}}_{\theta  \in \Theta }$ whose terms $q^{(\theta )}: Z \times X \to \R $ are such that $q^{(\theta )}(\cdot , \xi ): Z \to \R $ is a distribution (density) for every $\xi  \in X$.

\section*{Examples}

For example, let $\Theta  = [0, 1]$ and consider the family of distributions $\set{p^{(\theta )}: \set{0, 1} \to [0,1]}_{\theta \in [0,1]}$ defined by, for each $\theta  \in [0,1]$,
\[
p^{(\theta )}(1) = \theta  \text{ and } p^{(\theta )}(0) = 1-\theta .
\]
This family is called the \t{Bernoulli family} and $p^{(\theta )}$ is called a \t{Bernoulli distribution} with parameter $\theta $.

For a second example, let $\Theta  = \R  \times \R _{+}$ and consider the family of densities $\set{f^{(\theta )}: \R  \to \R }_{\theta  \in \Theta }$ defined by, for each $\theta  = (\mu , \sigma ) \in \Theta ,$
\[
f^{(\theta )}(x) = (1/\sqrt{2\pi }\sigma )\exp((x - \mu )/\sigma ^2).
\]
This family is called the \t{normal family} and $f^{(\theta )}$ with $\theta  = (\mu , \sigma )$ is called a \t{normal density} with mean $\mu $ and variance $\sigma ^2$.
