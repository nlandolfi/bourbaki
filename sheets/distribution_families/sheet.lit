§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬distribution family❭ (❬density family❭) on $X$ is a
    family of distributions (densities) $\set{p^{(θ)}}_{θ ∈ Θ}$ on
    $X$. ⦉

  <!-- for which $\Theta \subset \R^p$. -->

  ‖ We call the index set $Θ$ (see \sheetref{families}{Families})
    the ❬parameters❭. ⦉

  ‖ Frequently $Θ ⊂ 𝗥^p$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Similarly, a ❬conditional distribution family❭ (❬conditional
    density family❭) on $Z$ from $X$ is a family
    $\set{q^{(θ)}}_{θ ∈ Θ}$ whose terms $q^{(θ)}: Z ×X → 𝗥$ are
    such that $q^{(θ)}(·, ξ): Z → 𝗥$ is a distribution (density)
    for every $ξ ∈ X$. ⦉
⦉

§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ For example, let $Θ = [0, 1]$ and consider the family of
    distributions $\set{p^{(θ)}: \set{0, 1} → [0,1]}_{θ ∈ [0,1]}$
    defined by, for each $θ ∈ [0,1]$,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ p^{(θ)}(1) = θ \text{ and } p^{(θ)}(0) = 1-θ. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ This family is called the ❬Bernoulli family❭ and $p^{(θ)}$
    is called a ❬Bernoulli distribution❭ with parameter $θ$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ For a second example, let $Θ = 𝗥 ×𝗥_{+}$ and consider the
    family of densities $\set{f^{(θ)}: 𝗥 → 𝗥}_{θ ∈ Θ}$ defined
    by, for each $θ = (μ, σ) ∈ Θ,$
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ f^{(θ)}(x) = (1/√{2π}σ)\exp((x - μ)/σ^2). ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ This family is called the ❬normal family❭ and $f^{(θ)}$ with
    $θ = (μ, σ)$ is called a ❬normal density❭ with mean $μ$
    and variance $σ^2$. ⦉
