§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We often take the topology of a topological space as the
    generating set for the sigma algebra. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given a topological space, the ❬topological sigma algebra❭ is
    the sigma algebra generated by the topology. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(A, 𝒯)$ be a topological space. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the topological sigma algebra by $σ(𝒯)$. ⦉
