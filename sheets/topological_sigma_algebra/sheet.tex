\ssection{Why}

We often take the
topology of a topological
space as the generating
set for the sigma algebra.

\ssection{Definition}

Given a topological space, the
\ct{topological sigma algebra}{}
is the sigma algebra generated
by the topology.

\ssection{Notation}

Let $(A, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space.
We denote the
topological sigma algebra
by $\sigma(\mathcal{T})$.
