\section*{Why}

We often take the topology of a topological space as the generating set for the sigma algebra.

\section*{Definition}

Given a topological space, the \t{topological sigma algebra} is the sigma algebra generated by the topology.

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $(A, \mathcal{T} )$ be a topological space.
We denote the topological sigma algebra by $\sigma (\mathcal{T} )$.
