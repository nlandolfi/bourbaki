\ssection{Why}

We want a notion for a correspondence between two sets.

\ssection{Definition}

A \t{function} $f$ \t{from} a set $X$ \t{to} a set $Y$ is a relation (see \sheetref{relations}{Relations}) whose domain is $X$ and whose range is a subset of $Y$ such that for each $x \in X$, there exists a unique $y \in Y$ so that $(x, y) \in f$.

We call the unique $y \in Y$ the \t{result} of the function \t{at} the \t{argument} $x$.
We call $Y$ the \t{codomain}.
If the range is $Y$ we say that $f$ is a function from $X$ \t{onto} $Y$.
If distinct elements of $X$ are mapped to distinct elements of $y$, we say that the function is \t{one-to-one}.

% We know functions by how the associate elements of their codomain with elements of their domain.
We say that the function \t{maps} elements from the domain to the codomain.
Since the word function and the verb \say{maps} connote activity, some authors refer to the concept that we have defined as a function as the \t{graph} of a function---namely, the set of ordered pairs which that function produces---and leave the concept of function undefined.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $X$ and $Y$ denote sets.
We denote a function named $f$ whose domain is $X$ and whose codomain is $Y$ by $f: X \to Y$.
We read the notation aloud as \say{$f$ from $X$ to $Y$}.
We denote the set of all functions from $X$ to $Y$ (which is a subset of $\powerset{(X \times Y)}$) by $Y^{X}$.
A less standard but equally good notation is $X \to Y$, read aloud as \say{$A$ to $B$}.
Using the notations introduced so far, we denote that $f \in (A \to B)$ by $f: A \to B$.
We tend to denote function by lower case latin letters, especially $f$, $g$, and $h$.
$f$ is a mnemonic for function and $g$ and $h$ are nearby.

Let $f: A \to B$.
For each element $a \in A$, we denote the result of applying $f$ to $a$ by $f(a)$, read aloud \say{f of a.}
We sometimes drop the parentheses, and write the result as $f_a$, read aloud as \say{f sub a.}
Let $g: A \times B \to C$.
We often write $g(a,b)$ or $g_{ab}$ instead of $g((a,b))$.
We read $g(a, b)$ aloud as \say{g of a and b}.
We read $g_{ab}$ aloud as \say{g sub a b.}

\s{Examples}

If $X \subset Y$, the function $\Set{(x, y) \in X \times Y}{x = y}$ is the \t{inclusion map} of $X$ into $Y$.
We often introduce such a function as \say{the function from $X$ to $Y$ defined by $f(x) = y$}.
We mean by this that $f$ is a function and that we are specifying the appropraite ordered pairs using the statement, called \t{argument-value notation}.
The inclusion map of $X$ into $X$ is called the \t{identity map} of $X$.
If we view the identity map as a relation on $X$, it is the relation of equality on $X$.

The functions $f: (X \times Y) \to X$ defined by $f(x, y) = x$ is the \t{pair projection} of $X \times Y$ ono $X$.
Similarly $g: (X \times Y) \to Y$ defined by $g(x, y) = y$ is the pair projection of $X \times Y$ onto $Y$.
% The range of $f$ is the first coordinate projection of $f$ and the range of $g$ is the second coordinate projection of $f$ (see \sheetref{ordered_pair_projections}{Ordered Pair Projections}).
The identity map is one-to-one and onto, the inclusion maps are one-to-one but not always onto, and the pair projections are usually not one-to-one.
