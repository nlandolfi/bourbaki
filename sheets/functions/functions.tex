\stitle{Functions}

\ssection{Why}

We want a notion for a correspondence
between two sets.

\ssection{Definition}

A \ct{functional}{functional} relation
on two sets relates each element of the
first set with a unique element of the
second set.
A \ct{function}{function} is a
functional \rt{relation}{relation}.

The \ct{domain}{domain} of the function is
the first set and \ct{codomain}{codomain}
of the function is the second set.
The \rt{function}{function}
\ct{maps}{maps} elements
\ct{from}{functionfrom} the
\rt{domain}{domain} \ct{to}{functionto}
the \rt{codomain}{codomain}.
We call the codomain element associated
with the domain element the
\ct{result}{functionresult} of
\ct{applying}{functionapplication}
the function to the domain element.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets.
If $A$ is the domain and $B$ the codomain,
we denote the set of functions from $A$ to
$B$ by $A \to B$, read aloud as \say{A to B}.
%A function is an element of the set $A \to B$,

We denote functions by lower case latin letters,
especially $f$, $g$, and $h$.
The letter $f$ is a mnemonic for
\rt{function}{function};
$g$ and $h$ follow $f$ in the Latin alphabet.
We denote that $f \in (A \to B)$ by
$f: A \to B$, read aloud as
\say{f from A to B}.

Let $f: A \to B$.
For each element $a \in A$, we denote the
result of applying
$f$ to $a$ by $f(a)$, read aloud
\say{f of a.}
We sometimes drop the parentheses, and write
the result as $f_a$, read aloud as
\say{f sub a.}

Let $g: A \times B \to C$.
We often write $g(a,b)$ or $g_{ab}$
instead of $g((a,b))$.
We read $g(a, b)$ aloud as
\say{g of a and b}.
We read $g_{ab}$ aloud as
\say{g sub a b.}
