§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Consider bounding ⦉

  ‖ the measure where ⦉

  ‖ two functions differ. ⦉

  ‖ We would look at their ⦉

  ‖ absolute value, and the ⦉

  ‖ measure of where this ⦉

  ‖ is greater than zero. ⦉

  ‖ The absolute value of ⦉

  ‖ their difference is a ⦉

  ‖ non-negative measurable ⦉

  ‖ random variable. ⦉
⦉

§ Result ⦉

‖ We bound the measure ⦉

‖ that a non-negative ⦉

‖ measurable real-valued ⦉

‖ function exceeds some ⦉

‖ value by its integral. ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ ⦉

  ‖ be a measure space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $g: X → [0, ∞]$ ⦉

  ‖ be measurable. ⦉

  ‖ Then for all $t > 0$,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ μ(\Set*{x ∈ X}{g(x) ≥ t}) ≤ \frac{∈t g dμ}{t}. ⦉

  <proof>
    ‖ Let $A = \Set*{x ∈ X}{g(x) ≥ t}$. ⦉

    ‖ Define $h: X → R$ by
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ h(x) = \begin{cases} ⦉

        ‖ 1 ＆ \text{ if } g(x) ≥ t ᜶ ⦉

        ‖ 0 ＆ \text{ otherwise. } ⦉

        ‖ \end{cases} ⦉
      ⦉⦉

    ‖ First, $μ(A) = ∈t h dμ$. ⦉

    ‖ Second, $h ≤ g$. ⦉

    ‖ So:
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ μ(\Set*{x ∈ X}{g(x) ≥ t}) ⦉

        ‖ = ∫ h dμ ⦉

        ‖ ≤ ∫ g/t dμ ⦉

        ‖ = \frac{∫ g dμ}{t}. ⦉
