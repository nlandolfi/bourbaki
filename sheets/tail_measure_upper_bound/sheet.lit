§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Consider bounding the measure where two functions differ. ⦉

  ‖ We would look at their absolute value, and the measure of
    where this is greater than zero. ⦉

  ‖ The absolute value of their difference is a non-negative
    measurable random variable. ⦉
⦉

§ Result ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We bound the measure that a non-negative measurable
    real-valued function exceeds some value by its integral. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Suppose $g: X → 𝗥_+$ is measurable on $(X, 𝒜, μ)$. ⦉

  ‖ Then
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ μ(\Set*{x ∈ X}{g(x) ≥ t}) ≤ \frac{∫ g dμ}{t} ⦉

      ‖ \quad ⦉

      ‖ \text{ for all } t > 0 ⦉
    ⦉⦉
  <proof>
    ‖ Let $A = \Set*{x ∈ X}{g(x) ≥ t}$. ⦉

    ‖ Define $h: X → R$ by
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ h(x) = \begin{cases} ⦉

        ‖ 1 ＆ \text{ if } g(x) ≥ t ᜶ ⦉

        ‖ 0 ＆ \text{ otherwise. } ⦉

        ‖ \end{cases} ⦉
      ⦉⦉

    ‖ First, $μ(A) = ∫ h dμ$. ⦉

    ‖ Second, $h ≤ g$. ⦉

    ‖ So:
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ μ(\Set*{x ∈ X}{g(x) ≥ t}) ⦉

        ‖ = ∫ h dμ ⦉

        ‖ ≤ ∫ g/t dμ ⦉

        ‖ = \frac{∫ g dμ}{t}. ⦉
