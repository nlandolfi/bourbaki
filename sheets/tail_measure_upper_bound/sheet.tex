\ssection{Why}

Consider bounding
the measure where
two functions differ.
We would look at their
absolute value, and the
measure of where this
is greater than zero.
The absolute value of
their difference is a
non-negative measurable
random variable.

\ssection{Result}
We bound the measure
that a non-negative
measurable real-valued
function exceeds some
value by its integral.

\begin{prop}
Let $(X, \SA, \mu)$
be a measure space.
Let $g: X \to [0, \infty]$
be measurable.
Then for all $t > 0$,
\[
  \mu(\Set*{x \in X}{g(x) \geq t}) \leq \frac{\int g d\mu}{t}.
\]

\begin{proof}
  Let $A = \Set*{x \in X}{g(x) \geq t}$.
  Define $h: X \to R$ by
  \[
    h(x) = \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{ if } g(x) \geq t \\
      0 & \text{ otherwise. }
    \end{cases}
  \]
  First, $\mu(A) = \int h d\mu$.
  Second, $h \leq g$.
  So:
  \[
    \begin{aligned}
    \mu(\Set*{x \in X}{g(x) \geq t})
    &= \int h d\mu
    &\leq \int g/t d\mu
    &= \frac{\int g d\mu}{t}.
    \end{aligned}
  \]
\end{proof}
\end{prop}
