§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ What is the natural generalization of a smooth function to
    functions defined on sets of $𝗥^k$.

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $U ⊂ 𝗥^d$ be an open set (see
    \sheetref{real_open_sets}{Real Open Sets}). ⦉

  ‖ A function $f: U → 𝗥$ is ❬smooth❭ if all its partial
    derivatives exists and are continuous. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ More generally, let $X ⊂ 𝗥^d$. ⦉

  ‖ A function $f: X → R$ is ❬smooth❭ if there exists an open
    set $U ⊂ 𝗥^d$ and a smooth $F: U → 𝗥$ so that $F(x) =
    f(x)$ for all $x ∈ U ∩ X$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Example ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The identity map is smooth. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, let $f: 𝗥^d → 𝗥$ be so that $X ⊂ 𝗥^d$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $f: X → 𝗥$ s ⦉

§ Properties ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ The composition of two smooth functions is smooth. ⦉
