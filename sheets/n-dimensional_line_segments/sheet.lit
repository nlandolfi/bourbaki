§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬closed line segment between❭ two points in
    $n$-dimensional space is the set of points which can be
    expressed as the sum of the first point and a scalar
    multiple of the difference between the second point and the
    first; where the scalar is in the interval $[0, 1]$. ⦉

  ‖ Thus, the closed line segment between two points is a
    subset of the line though the two points. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬open line segment❭ between $x$ and $y$ is the closed
    line segment with the points $x$ and $y$. ⦉
