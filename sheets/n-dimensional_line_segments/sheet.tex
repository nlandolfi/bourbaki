\section*{Definition}

The \t{closed line segment between} two points in $n$-dimensional space is the set of points which can be expressed as the sum of the first point and a scalar multiple of the difference between the second point and the first; where the scalar is in the interval $[0, 1]$.
Thus, the closed line segment between two points is a subset of the line though the two points.
The \t{open line segment} between $x$ and $y$ is the closed line segment with the points $x$ and $y$.
