\section*{Definition}

The \t{closed line segment} (or \t{interval}) between two points in $n$-dimensional space is the set of points which can be expressed as the sum of the first point and a scalar multiple of the difference between the second point and the first; where the scalar is in the interval $[0, 1]$.
Thus, the closed line segment between two points is a subset of the line though the two points.
The \t{open line segment} between $x$ and $y$ is the closed line segment with the points $x$ and $y$.

\subsection*{Notation}

We denote the closed line segment between $x$ and $y$ by $[x, y]$.
So,
\[
[x,y] = \Set*{x + \alpha (y-x)}{0 \leq \alpha  \leq 1}
\]
Notice that $x + \alpha (y - x) = (1-\alpha )x + \alpha y$.
Similarly, we denote the open line segment by $(x, y)$.
These notations pleasantly generalize that of real intervals.
