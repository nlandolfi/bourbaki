\section*{Why}

We name lists of lists, and so on.

\section*{Definition}

Let $s$ be a sequence of natural numbers: $s = (n_1, \dots , n_d)$.
An \t{array} of \t{size} (or \t{shape}) $s$ is a function whose domain is the set
\[
I = \Set{(m_1, \dots , m_d)}{ 1 \leq m_1 \leq n_1, \dots , 1 \leq m_d \leq n_d}.
\]
We call the set $I$ the set of \t{indices} of the array.
We call the codomain of the function the set of \t{values} of the array.
If $A$ is the set of values, we say that the array is \t{in} A.
We call the length of $s$ (here denoted $d$) the \t{dimension} of the array.

\subsection*{Case $d = 1$}

If the shape of the array has length one, then the array is no different from a sequence.
In this case, the terminology for arrays coincides with that for sequences.

\subsection*{Case $d = 2$}

If the shape of the array has length two, then the array can is a \t{table} with $n_1$ rows and $n_2$ columns.\footnote{Compare with \sheetref{matrices}{Matrices}.}
We say that the array is two-dimensional.
We denote the $n_1 \times  n_2$ array with elements in the set $A$ by $A^{n_1 \times  n_2}$.

\subsection*{Simplified indices}

In the case that $a$ is a one-dimensional array, or sequence, we use the common terminology $a_i$ for the $i$th element of $a$
In the case that $a$ is a two dimensional array, we write $a_{ij}$ for $a_{(i,j)}$.
