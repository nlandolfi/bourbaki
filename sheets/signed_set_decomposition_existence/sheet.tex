\section*{Why}

Does a signed-set decomposition exist for any signed measure?

\section*{Result}

The answer is yes.

\begin{proposition}
Let $(X, \mathcal{A} )$ be
a measurable space.
Let $\mu : \mathcal{A}  \to \eri$
be a signed measure.
There exists a signed-set
decomposition of $X$ under $\mu $.

\end{proposition}
