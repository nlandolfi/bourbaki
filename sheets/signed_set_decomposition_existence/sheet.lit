§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Does a signed-set decomposition exist for any signed measure? ⦉
⦉

§ Result ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The answer is yes. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜)$ be ⦉

    ‖ a measurable space. ⦉

    ‖ Let $μ: 𝒜 → \eri$ ⦉

    ‖ be a signed measure. ⦉

    ‖ There exists a signed-set ⦉

    ‖ decomposition of $X$ under $μ$. ⦉
