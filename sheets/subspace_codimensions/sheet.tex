\section*{Definition}

Suppose $W$ is a subspace of a vector space $V$.
The \t{codimension} of $W$ \t{in} $V$ is the difference of the dimension of $V$ and the dimension of $W$.
In this context, $V$ is called the \t{ambient space} of $W$.

\subsection*{Notation}

As usual, let $\dim W$ and $\dim V$ denote the dimensions of $W$ and $V$, respectively
We denote the codomension of $W$ in $V$ by $\codim(W)$
