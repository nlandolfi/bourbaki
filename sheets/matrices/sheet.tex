\ssection{Why}

\ssection{Definition}

Consider two sets: the natural numbers from
$1$ to $n$ and those from $1$ to $m$.
Consider a third non-empty set.
A \t{matrix of} elements of the third set is a function from the cartesian product of the first two sets of natural numbers to the third set.
We call such a function a \t{matrix}
We call the function's values the \t{entries} of the matrix.

We think of the objects in the third set as arrayed in a grid or arrayed in a table.
We call $n$ and $m$ the \t{dimensions} of the matrix.
We call $n$ the \t{height} and $m$ the \t{width}.
If the height of the matrix is the same as the width of the matrix then we call the matrix \t{square}.
If the height is larger than the width, we call the matrix \t{tall}.
If the width is larger than the height, we call the matrix \t{wide}.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $S$ be nonempty set.
We denote the set of $n \times m$ $S$-valued matrices by $\Mat{S}{n}{m}$.
Let $a \in \Mat{S}{n}{m}$.
This means the same as $a: \upto{n} \cross \upto{m} \to S$.
We denote $a(i, j)$ by $a_{ij}$.
