\section*{Why}

We generalize the notion of real matrices, to matrices with elements in any set.

\section*{Definition}

Let $S$ be a set.
A \t{matrix} \t{in} $S$ (or \t{of} elements in $S$) is a two-dimensional array in $S$.
We call the matrice's values the \t{entries} of the matrix.

As with real matrices, we think of the objects in the codo set as arrayed in a grid or arrayed in a table.
We call $n$ and $m$ the \t{dimensions} of the matrix.
We call $n$ the \t{height} and $m$ the \t{width}.
If the height of the matrix is the same as the width of the matrix then we call the matrix \t{square}.
If the height is larger than the width, we call the matrix \t{tall}.
If the width is larger than the height, we call the matrix \t{wide}.

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $S$ be nonempty set.
We denote the set of $n \times m$ $S$-valued matrices by $\Mat{S}{n}{m}$.
Let $a \in \Mat{S}{n}{m}$.
This means the same as $a: \upto{n} \cross \upto{m} \to S$.
We denote $a(i, j)$ by $a_{ij}$.
