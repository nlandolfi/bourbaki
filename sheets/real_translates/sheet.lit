§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬translate❭ of $S ⊂ 𝗥^n$ ❬by❭ $a ∈ 𝗥^n$ is the set
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \Set*{z ∈ 𝗥^n}{∃x ∈ S \text{ such that } z = x + a}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We often use the abbreviated notation $S + a$ for the
    translate of $S$ by $a$. ⦉

  ‖ It is sometimes also convenient to extend set-builder
    notation and write
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ S + a = \Set{x + a}{x ∈ M}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ The right hand side is slick notation for the definition
    given above. ⦉
⦉

§ Sums and differences ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬sum❭ of two sets $S, T ⊂ 𝗥^n$ is the set
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \Set{z ∈ 𝗥^n}{(∃x ∈ S)(∃y ∈ T)(z = x + y)}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Likewise, the ❬difference❭ of two sets $S, T ⊂ 𝗥^n$ is the
    set
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \Set{z ∈ 𝗥^n}{(∃x ∈ S)(∃y ∈ T)(z = x - y)}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the sum of $S$ and $T$ by $S + T$, and the
    difference by $S - T$. ⦉

  ‖ We often use the slick notation
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \Set{x + y}{x ∈ S, y ∈ T} \text{ and } \Set{x - y}{x
        ∈ S, y ∈ T}, ⦉
    ⦉
    for these two sets. ⦉
