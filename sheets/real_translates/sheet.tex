\section*{Definition}

The \t{translate} of $S \subset \R ^n$ \t{by} $a \in \R ^n$ is the set
  \[
\Set*{z \in \R ^n}{\exists x \in S \text{ such that } z = x + a}.
  \]

\subsection*{Notation}

We often use the abbreviated notation $S + a$ for the translate of $S$ by $a$.
It is sometimes also convenient to extend set-builder notation and write
  \[
S + a = \Set{x + a}{x \in M}.
  \]
The right hand side is slick notation for the definition given above.

\section*{Sums and differences}

The \t{sum} of two sets $S, T \subset \R ^n$ is the set
  \[
\Set{z \in \R ^n}{(\exists x \in S)(\exists y \in T)(z = x + y)}.
  \]
Likewise, the \t{difference} of two sets $S, T \subset \R ^n$ is the set
  \[
\Set{z \in \R ^n}{(\exists x \in S)(\exists y \in T)(z = x - y)}.
  \]

\subsection*{Notation}

We denote the sum of $S$ and $T$ by $S + T$, and the difference by $S - T$.
We often use the slick notation
  \[
\Set{x + y}{x \in S, y \in T} \text{ and } \Set{x - y}{x \in S, y \in T},
  \]
for these two sets.
