\ssection{Why}

We want to find roots of negative numbers

\ssection{Definition}

A \t{complex number} is an ordered pair of real numbers.
The \t{real part} of a complex number is its first coordinate.
The \t{imaginary part} of a complex number is its second coordinate.


\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $z$ be a complex number.
We denote the real part of $z$ by $\re(z)$, read \say{real of z,} and the imaginary part by $\im(z)$, read \say{imaginary of z.}
So if $z = (a, b)$, then $\re(z) = a$ and $\im(z) = b$.
