§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to find the roots of negative numbers.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will modify this, and will discuss the
        existence of solutions of algebraic equations. ⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬complex number❭ is an ordered pair of real numbers. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬real part❭ of a complex number is its first coordinate. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬imaginary part❭ of a complex number is its second
    coordinate. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We can identify the imaginary numbers with no complex part
    (i.e., $\Set*{(a, b) ∈ 𝗥^2}{b = 0}$ with $𝗥$ in the obvious
    way. ⦉

  ‖ For this reason, such a complex number is sometimes referred
    to as a ❬purely real number❭ ⦉

  ‖ Conversely, a complex number with zero imaginary part (i.e.,
    an element of $\Set*{(a, b) ∈ 𝗥^2}{a = 0}$) is said to be
    a ❬purely imaginary number❭. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ When treating $𝗥^2$ as the set of complex numbers, we
    denote it by $𝗖$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $z ∈ 𝗖$ with $z = (a, b)$. ⦉

  ‖ The real part of $z$ is $a$ and its imaginary part is $b$. ⦉

  ‖ It is universal to denote $z$ by $a + ib$, and to call
    $i$ an (or the) ❬imaginary number❭. ⦉

  ‖ Some authors use $j$, it is a matter of notation. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the real part of $z$ by $\re(z)$, read “real of
    z,” and the imaginary part by $\im(z)$, read “imaginary of
    z.” ⦉

  ‖ So, in particular, $\re(z) = a$ and $\im(z) = b$. ⦉
