\ssection{Why}

We often have two alebgras for which we can identify elements of the ground set.

\ssection{Definition}

Let $(A, +_{A})$ and $(B, +_B)$ be two algebras.\footnote{Future editions will change this notation to avoid clashes with right and left identity elements (see \sheetref{identity_elements}{Identity Elements}).}

An \t{isomorphism} between these two algebras is a bijection $f: A \to B$ satisfying:
\[
  f(a \, +_A \, a') =  f(a) \, +_B \, f(a')
\]
and
\[
  f^{-1}(b +_B b') = f^{-1}(b) +_A f^{-1}(b').
\]
