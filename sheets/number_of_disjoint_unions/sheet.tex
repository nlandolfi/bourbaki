We call two sets $A$, $B$ \t{disjoint} or \t{non-overlapping}\footnote{Future sheets may move this definition elsewhere.}
if $A \cap  B = \varnothing$.

\begin{proposition}
Suppose $A$ and $B$ are disjoint finite sets.
Then $\num{A \cup B} = \num{A} + \num{B}$
\end{proposition}

This is often called the \t{addition principle} or the \t{rule of sum}.
