\ssection{Why}
A point in the plane can be \textit{interpreted} as a \textit{displacement}.

\ssection{Definition}
A \t{plane vector} (or \t{vector}, \t{two-dimensional vector}, \t{2-vector}) is an element of $\R ^2$.
We associate a list of two numbers with a point in the plane, a \textit{location}.
We also associate a list of two numbers with a \textit{displacement}, a \textit{change} in location.

\ssubsection{Visualization}
As in plane geometry, pictures are indispensable (though they are not proofs).
In the figure, indicate the vectors $x, y \in \R ^2$ on a plane.
We have also indicated the origin, $(0, 0)$, as usual.

\ssubsection{Note on terminology}
The English word \say{vector} is from the same Latin word \say{vector,} meaning, literally, carrier.
This sense is from the interpretation of a vector as indicating a displacement.
