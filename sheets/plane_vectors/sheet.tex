\section*{Why}

A point in the plane can be \textit{interpreted} as a \textit{displacement}.

\section*{Definition}

A \t{plane vector} (or \t{vector}, \t{two-dimensional vector}, \t{2-vector}) is an element of $\R ^2$.
We associate a list of two numbers with a point in the plane, a \textit{location}.
We also associate a list of two numbers with a \textit{displacement}, a \textit{change} in location.

\subsection*{Visualization}

As in plane geometry, pictures are indispensable (though they are not proofs).
In the figure, indicate the vectors $x, y \in \R ^2$ on a plane.
We have also indicated the origin, $(0, 0)$, as usual.

\subsection*{Note on terminology}

The English word ``vector'' is from the same Latin word ``vector,'' meaning, literally, carrier.
This sense is from the interpretation of a vector as indicating a displacement.
