  ‖ \ssection{Why} ⦉

  ‖ A point in the plane can be ‹interpreted› as a
    ‹displacement›. ⦉

  ‖ \ssection{Definition} ⦉

  ‖ A ❬plane vector❭ (or ❬vector❭, ❬two-dimensional vector❭,
    ❬2-vector❭) is an element of $𝗥^2$. ⦉

  ‖ We associate a list of two numbers with a point in the
    plane, a ‹location›. ⦉

  ‖ We also associate a list of two numbers with a
    ‹displacement›, a ‹change› in location. ⦉
⦉

  ‖ \ssubsection{Visualization} ⦉

  ‖ As in plane geometry, pictures are indispensable (though they
    are not proofs). ⦉

  ‖ In the figure, indicate the vectors $x, y \in 𝗥^2$ on a
    plane. ⦉

  ‖ We have also indicated the origin, $(0, 0)$, as usual. ⦉

  ‖ \ssubsection{Note on terminology} ⦉

  ‖ The English word “vector” is from the same Latin word
    “vector,” meaning, literally, carrier. ⦉

  ‖ This sense is from the interpretation of a vector as
    indicating a displacement. ⦉
