\stitle{Data Set}

\ssection{Why}

We want language to talk about
a list of elements from a set.

\ssection{Definition}

A \ct{data set}{} is a finite
sequence of elements from a set.
The \ct{size}{} of a data set
is the number of elements in the
sequence.

We call an element of the
data set a \ct{record}{}.

\subsection{Notation}

Let $A$ be a non-empty set.
We usually denote data sets
by $(a_1, \dots, a_n)$
Here we will use
$(a^1, \dots, a^n)$.
since often $A$ is itself
a set of sequences,
and we will want to refer
to the $i$th component of
$a^1$ by $a^1_i$.
