§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬$i$th marginal density❭ of a multivariate density is
    the density obtained by integrating over every component with
    a particular component fixed. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Similalry the ❬$i,j$th marginal density❭ of a multivariate
    density is the density obtained by integrated over every
    component with the $i$ and $j$th components fixed. ⦉
⦉

§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $f: 𝗥^d → 𝗥$ be a density. ⦉

  ‖ For $i = 1, …, d$, let $f_i: 𝗥 → 𝗥$ be defined by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ f(ξ) = ∫_{\Set*{x ∈ 𝗥^d}{x_i = ξ}} f ⦉
    ⦉
    for each $ξ ∈ 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $f_i$ is the $i$th marginal density of $f$. ⦉
