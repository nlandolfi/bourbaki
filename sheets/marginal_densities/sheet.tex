\section*{Definition}

The \t{$i$th marginal density} of a multivariate density is the density obtained by integrating over every component with a particular component fixed.

Similalry the \t{$i,j$th marginal density} of a multivariate density is the density obtained by integrated over every component with the $i$ and $j$th components fixed.

\section*{Notation}

Let $f: \R ^d \to \R $ be a density.
For $i = 1, \dots , d$, let $f_i: \R  \to \R $ be defined by
\[
f(\xi ) = \int _{\Set*{x \in \R ^d}{x_i = \xi }} f
\]
for each $\xi  \in \R $.
Then $f_i$ is the $i$th marginal density of $f$.
