\ssection{Definition}

The \ct{$i$th marginal density}{}
of a multivariate density is the
density obtained by integrating
over every component with a
particular component fixed.

Similalry the \ct{$i,j$th marginal density}{}
of a multivariate density is the density obtained
by integrated over every component with the
$i$ and $j$th components fixed.

\ssection{Notation}

Let $f: \R^d \to \R$ be
a density.
For $i = 1, \dots, d$, let
$f_i: \R \to \R$ be defined
by
\[
  f(\xi) = \int_{\Set*{x \in \R^d}{x_i = \xi}} f
\]
for each $\xi \in \R$,
Then $f_i$ is the $i$th marginal density of
$f$.
