\stitle{Prelations}

\ssection{Why}

We want to talk relationships
of perceptions in time or
relationships of perceptions in
space.
We will model the perceptions
we recieve first in time or the
perceptions we can see in space
with those we will see later in
time or, through much effort
or more investigation, which we
could see later in space.

\ssection{Definition}

Let $\CU$ be a set
and $\CV$ be a set.
We call $\CU$ the
\ct{precepts}{}
and $\CV$ the \ct{postcepts}{}.
A \ct{prelation}{} is
a relation between precepts
and postcepts.
Our first perception is an
element of the precepts and
our second perception is an
element of the postcepts.
The prelation dictates which
postcepts can follow precepts.


The prelation may be
complete, in that any two precepts
and postcepts may be related.
Or the prelation may
be functional, in that any given
precept is related to a particular
postcept.
Or a precept may be related
to several postcepts.

If the prelation is complete, we say
call it \ct{unpresumptive}{}.
If the prelation is functional, we call
it \ct{presumptive}{}.
