\ssection{Definition}

A \t{random variable} is a measurable map from a probability space to a measurable space.

A \t{real-valued random variable} is a measurable map between the probability space and the set of real numbers with its topological sigma algebra.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(X, \SA, \PM)$ be a probability space.
Let $(Y, \SB)$ a measurable space.
Then a random variable is a measurable function $f: X \to Y$.

Some authors denote real-valued random variables by upper case Latin letters:
for example, $X, Y, Z$.  In this case, the base probability space is denoted by $\Omega$, a mnemonic for \say{outcomes.}.
Let $(\Omega,\SA,\PM)$ be a probability space.
Let $X: \Omega \to \R$ be measurable.
Then $X$ is a real-valued random variable.

Some authors use notation for the probability of certain common sets.
Let $A \in \SB(R)$.
Let $\PM(X \in A)$ denote $\PM(X^{-1}(A))$.
These are equivalent to
\[
  \PM(\Set*{\omega \in \Omega}{X(\omega) \in A}).
\]

Next, let $Y: \Omega \to R$
a measurable function and
let $B \in \SB(R)$.
Similar to the above,
let $\PM(X \in A,Y \in B)$
denote $\PM(X^{-1}(A) \intersect Y^{-1}(B))$.
These are equivalent to
\[
  \PM(\Set*{\omega \in \Omega}{X(\omega) \in A \text{ and } Y(\omega) \in B}).
\]
