\section*{Definition}

A \t{random variable} is a measurable map from a probability space to a measurable space.

A \t{real-valued random variable} is a measurable map between the probability space and the set of real numbers with its topological sigma algebra.

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $(X, \mathcal{A} , \mathbfsf{P} )$ be a probability space.
Let $(Y, \mathcal{B} )$ a measurable space.
A random variable is a measurable function $f: X \to Y$.

Some authors denote real-valued random variables by upper case Latin letters: for example, $X, Y, Z$.
In this case, the base probability space is denoted by $\Omega $, a mnemonic for \say{outcomes.}
Let $(\Omega ,\mathcal{A} ,\mathbfsf{P} )$ be a probability space.
Let $X: \Omega  \to \R $ be measurable.
Then $X$ is a real-valued random variable.

Some authors use notation for the probability of particular, common sets.
Although the authors often use regular parentheses, we will use \say{$[$} and \say{$]$} for precision.
Let $A \in \mathcal{B} (\R )$.
Let $\mathbfsf{P} [X \in A]$ denote $\mathbfsf{P} (X^{-1}(A))$.
These are equivalent to
  \[
\mathbfsf{P} (\Set*{\omega  \in \Omega }{X(\omega ) \in A}).
  \]
As we mentioned, some authors use $P(X \in A)$ for $P[X \in A]$, which is mostly harmless.

Next, let $Y: \Omega  \to \R $ a measurable function and let $B \in \mathcal{B} (\R )$.
Similar to the above, let $\mathbfsf{P} [X \in A, Y \in B]$ denote $\mathbfsf{P} (X^{-1}(A) \cap  Y^{-1}(B))$.
These are equivalent to
  \[
\mathbfsf{P} (\Set*{\omega  \in \Omega }{X(\omega ) \in A \text{ and } Y(\omega ) \in B}).
  \]
Similarly for $n$ random variables $X_1, \dots , X_n: \Omega \to \R $,
  \[
\mathbfsf{P} [X_1 \in A_1, \dots , X_n \in A_n] = \mathbfsf{P} (\cap _{i = 1}^{n} X_i^{-1}(A_i)).
  \]
