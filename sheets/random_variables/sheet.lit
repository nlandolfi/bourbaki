¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬random variable❭ is a measurable map from a probability
    space to a measurable space. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬real-valued random variable❭ is a measurable map between
    the probability space and the set of real numbers with its
    topological sigma algebra. ⦉

⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, \SA, \PM)$ be a probability space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $(Y, \SB)$ a measurable space. ⦉

  ‖ Then a random variable is a measurable function $f: X → Y$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Some authors denote real-valued random variables by upper
    case Latin letters: ⦉

  ‖ for example, $X, Y, Z$. In this case, the base probability
    space is denoted by $\Omega$, a mnemonic for “outcomes.} ⦉

  ‖ Let $(\Omega,\SA,\PM)$ be a probability space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $X: \Omega → 𝗥$ be measurable. ⦉

  ‖ Then $X$ is a real-valued random variable. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Some authors use notation for the probability of particular,
    common sets. ⦉

  ‖ Although the authors often use regular parentheses, we will
    use \say{$[$} and \say{$]$} for precision. ⦉

  ‖ Let $A ∈ \SB(𝗥)$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $\PM[X ∈ A]$ denote $\PM(X^{-1}(A))$. ⦉

  ‖ These are equivalent to
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \PM(\Set*{ω ∈ \Omega}{X(ω) ∈ A}). ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ As we mentioned, some authors use $P(X ∈ A)$ for $P[X ∈
    A]$, which is mostly harmless. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Next, let $Y: \Omega → 𝗥$ a measurable function and let $B
    ∈ \SB(𝗥)$. ⦉

  ‖ Similar to the above, ⦉

  ‖ let $\PM[X ∈ A,Y ∈ B]$ ⦉

  ‖ denote $\PM(X^{-1}(A) ∫ersect Y^{-1}(B))$. ⦉

  ‖ These are equivalent to
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \PM(\Set*{ω ∈ \Omega}{X(ω) ∈ A \text{ and } Y(ω) ∈ B}). ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Similarly for $n$ random variables $X_1, …, X_n: \Omega →
    𝗥$,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \PM[X_1 ∈ A_1, …, X_n ∈ A_n] = \PM(∫ersect_{i = 1}^{n}
        X_i^{-1”(A_i)). ⦉
