§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬random variable❭ is a measurable map from a probability
    space to a measurable space. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬real-valued random variable❭ is a measurable map between
    the probability space and the set of real numbers with its
    topological sigma algebra. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜, 𝗣)$ be a probability space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $(Y, ℬ)$ a measurable space. ⦉

  ‖ A random variable is a measurable function $f: X → Y$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Some authors denote real-valued random variables by upper
    case Latin letters: for example, $X, Y, Z$. ⦉

  ‖ In this case, the base probability space is denoted by $Ω$,
    a mnemonic for “outcomes.” ⦉

  ‖ Let $(Ω,𝒜,𝗣)$ be a probability space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $X: Ω → 𝗥$ be measurable. ⦉

  ‖ Then $X$ is a real-valued random variable. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Some authors use notation for the probability of particular,
    common sets. ⦉

  ‖ Although the authors often use regular parentheses, we will
    use “$[$” and “$]$” for precision. ⦉

  ‖ Let $A ∈ ℬ(𝗥)$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $𝗣[X ∈ A]$ denote $𝗣(X^{-1}(A))$. ⦉

  ‖ These are equivalent to
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ 𝗣(\Set*{ω ∈ Ω}{X(ω) ∈ A}). ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ As we mentioned, some authors use $P(X ∈ A)$ for $P[X ∈
    A]$, which is mostly harmless. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Next, let $Y: Ω → 𝗥$ a measurable function and let $B ∈
    ℬ(𝗥)$. ⦉

  ‖ Similar to the above, let $𝗣[X ∈ A, Y ∈ B]$ denote
    $𝗣(X^{-1}(A) ∩ Y^{-1}(B))$. ⦉

  ‖ These are equivalent to
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ 𝗣(\Set*{ω ∈ Ω}{X(ω) ∈ A \text{ and } Y(ω) ∈ B}). ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Similarly for $n$ random variables $X_1, …, X_n: Ω → 𝗥$,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ 𝗣[X_1 ∈ A_1, …, X_n ∈ A_n] = 𝗣(∩_{i = 1}^{n}
        X_i^{-1”(A_i)). ⦉
