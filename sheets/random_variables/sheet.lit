§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬random variable❭ is a measurable map from a probability
    space to a measurable space. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬real-valued random variable❭ is a measurable map between
    the probability space and the set of real numbers with its
    topological sigma algebra. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜, 𝗣)$ be a probability space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $(Y, ℬ)$ a measurable space. ⦉

  ‖ A random variable is a measurable function $f: X → Y$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Some authors tend to denote real-valued random variables by
    upper case Latin letters: for example, $X, Y, Z$. ⦉

  ‖ They reserve lower case letters $x$, $y$, $z$ for the
    elements of the codomains of these functions. ⦉

  ‖ In such cases, they often denote the set of outcomes as
    $Ω$, which␣
    <a href='/sheets/probability_measures.html#Notation'>
      ‖ we have mentioned ⦉
    </a>
    ␣is a mnemonic for outcomes. ⦉
⦉

§§ Special notation for common cases ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Some authors use notation for the probability of particular,
    common sets. ⦉

  ‖ Suppose $(Ω, 𝒜, 𝗣)$ is a probability space with $X: Ω →
    𝗥$ a real-valued random variable. ⦉

  ‖ Many authors use $𝗣(X ∈ A)$ (or $P(X ∈ A)$, no bold) to
    denote
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ 𝗣(X^{-1}(A)) = 𝗣(\Set*{ω ∈ Ω}{X(ω) ∈ A}) ⦉
    ⦉
    where $A ∈ ℬ(𝗥)$, the Borel sigma algebra on $𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ We will tend to use brackets in place of parentheses for
    clarity. ⦉

  ‖ So we will write $𝗣[ X ∈ A ]$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Similar to the above, suppose $Y: Ω → 𝗥$ is a random
    variable and $B ∈ ℬ(𝗥)$. ⦉

  ‖ Then we will use $𝗣[X ∈ A, Y ∈ B]$ to denote
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ 𝗣(X^{-1}(A) ∩ Y^{-1}(B)) = 𝗣(\Set*{ω ∈ Ω}{X(ω) ∈ A
        \text{ and } Y(ω) ∈ B}). ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Similarly for $n$ random variables $X_1, …, X_n: Ω → 𝗥$,
    and Borel sets $A_1, …, A_n$, we will use $𝗣[X_1 ∈ A_1, …,
    X_n ∈ A_n]$ to denote $𝗣(∩_{i = 1}^{n} X_i^{-1}(A_i))$. ⦉
