§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A nonempty set $S ⊂ 𝗥^n$ is called a ❬subspace❭ (❬linear
    subspace❭) if
    𝍫 ⦊
      ‣ $x + y ∈ S$ for all $x, y ∈ S$, and ⦉

      ‣ $αx ∈ S$ for all $α ∈ 𝗥$, $x ∈ S$. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ We say that that $S$ is (1) ❬closed under vector addition❭
    and (2) ❬closed under scalar multiplication❭. ⦉
⦉

§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The set $S_1 = 𝗥^n$ is a subspace. In other words, the
    entire set is a subspace of itself. ⦉

  ‖ The set $S_2 = \set{0}$, consisting of a single point, the
    origin, is a subspace. ⦉

  ‖ $S_1$ is the biggest subspace. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, if $S'$ is another subspace of $𝗥^n$, then
    $S' ⊂ S_1$. ⦉

  ‖ If $S$ is a subspace, it is nonempty, so there is $x ∈
    S$, and it is closed under scalar multiplication, so $0·x =
    0 ∈ S$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, every subspace contains the origin. ⦉

  ‖ So $S_2$ is the smallest subspace, in the sense that if
    $S'$ is another subspace $S_2 ⊂ S'$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The span (see \sheetref{real_vectors_span}{Real Vectors Span})
    of a set of vectors $v_1, …, v_k$ is a subspace. ⦉

  ‖ For two subspaces $S, T ⊂ 𝗥^n$, their sum
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ S + T = \Set{x + y}{x ∈ S, y ∈ T} ⦉
    ⦉
    is a subspace. ⦉
⦉

§§ Geometric intuition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Roughly speaking, a subspace $S$ is a flat set which passes
    through the origin. ⦉

  ‖ In $𝗥^2$, the subspaces are the lines. ⦉

  ‖ In $𝗥^3$, the lines and the planes. ⦉
