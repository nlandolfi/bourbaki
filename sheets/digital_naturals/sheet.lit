§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to associate the natural numbers with bit strings
    for use on digital computers.

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬digital natural❭ is a bit string. ⦉

  ‖ The set of ❬$d$-bit digtal natural numbers❭ is the set of
    length-$d$ bit strings $\set{0, 1}^d$. ⦉

  ‖ For example, the set of 8-bit digital naturals is the set
    $\set{0, 1}^8$. ⦉
⦉

§ Correspondence with $𝗡 ∪ \set{0}$ ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We associate $x ∈ \set{0, 1}^d$ corresponds to the number
    $∑_{i = 1}^{d} x_i 2^i$. ⦉

  ‖ For example, the bit string $(0,0,0) ∈ \set{0, 1}^3$
    corresponds to the natural number $0 ∈ ω$. ⦉

  ‖ Likewise, $(1, 0, 0)$ corresponds to $1 ∈ 𝗡$, $(0, 1, 0)$
    corresponds to 2, $(1, 1, 0)$ corresponds to 3, etc. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Call the function so defined the ❬digital natural decoder❭,
    and denote it by $f: \set{0, 1}^d → 𝗡 ∪ \set{0}$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words $f((0, 0, 0)) = 0$, $f((0, 1, 0)) = 2$,
    etc. ⦉

  ‖ Call the set $f(\set{0, 1}^d)$ the set of naturals
    ❬representable❭ by length-$d$ bit strings. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Specifically, if, for $n ∈ 𝗡 ∪ \set{0, 1}$, there exists
    $x ∈ \set{0, 1}^d$ so that $f(x) = n$, we say that $x$ is
    ❬representable in $d$ bits❭. ⦉
⦉

§ Correspondence between $d$ and $k > d$ bit naturals ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $x ∈ \set{0, 1}^d$ and $y ∈ \set{0, 1}^k$ with $k >
    d$. ⦉

  ‖ Although $\set{0, 1}^d \not⊂ \set{0, 1}^k$, $f(\set{0, 1}^d)
    ⊂ f(\set{0, 1}^k)$. ⦉

  ‖ We can identify $x ∈ \set{0, 1}^d$ with $x' ∈ \set{0,
    1}^k$ where $x' = (x_1, …, x_d, 0, …, 0)$ so that $f(x) =
    f(x')$. ⦉

  ‖ Clearly then, if $x$ is representable in $d$ bits, it is
    representable in $k > d$ bits. ⦉
⦉

§ Addition ⦉

‖   <!-- right now, natural sums comes as a need through bit strings, but this could change in the future.-->
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ We want to define addition $\oplus: \set{0, 1}^d ×\set{0,
      1}^d → \set{0, 1}^d$ so that $f(x \oplus x') = f(x) +
      f(x')$. ⦉

    ‖ In general, we are stuck, because $x + x'$ may not be
      representable in $d$ bits. ⦉

    ‖ Suppose, however and for the time being, that it is.
