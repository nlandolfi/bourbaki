\section*{Why}

In some sense, $\R ^n$ is the only finite-dimensional vector space.
In what sense?

\section*{Definition}

An \t{isomorphism} is an invertible linear transformation between two vector spaces.
Two vector spaces are \t{isomorphic} if there exists and isomorphism between them.

\section*{Key result}

\begin{proposition}
Two finite-dimensional vector spaces are isomorphic if and only if they have the same dimension.
\end{proposition}
