\ssection{Why}

In some sense, $\R^n$ is the only finite-dimensional vector space.
In what sense?

\ssection{Definition}

An \t{isomorphism} is an invertible linear transformation between two vector spaces.
Two vector spaces are \t{isomorphic} if there exists and isomorphism between them.

\ssection{Key Result}

\begin{prop}
  Two finite-dimensional vector spaces are isomorphic if and only if they have the same dimension.
\end{prop}

\begin{corr}
  Two finite-dimensional vector spaces are isomorphic if and only if they have the same dimension.
\end{corr}
