§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ In some sense, $𝗥^n$ is the only finite-dimensional vector
    space. ⦉

  ‖ In what sense? ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ An ❬isomorphism❭ is an invertible linear transformation
    between two vector spaces. ⦉

  ‖ Two vector spaces are ❬isomorphic❭ if there exists and
    isomorphism between them. ⦉
⦉

§ Key result ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Two finite-dimensional vector spaces are isomorphic if and
    only if they have the same dimension. ⦉
