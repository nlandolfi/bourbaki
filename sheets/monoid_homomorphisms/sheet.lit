§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We name a function which preserves algebraic structure. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $G$ and $G'$ are the ground sets of two monoids. ⦉

  ‖ A ❬homomorphism❭ (or ❬monoid homomorphism❭) between the
    monoids is a function $f: G → G'$ such that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ f(xy) = f(x)f(y) \quad \text{for all } x, y ∈ G ⦉
    ⦉
    ‹and› which maps the unit in $G$ to the unit in $G'$. ⦉

  ‖ If the groups are identical, then we call $f$ an
    ❬endomorphism❭ (or ❬monoid endomorphism❭). ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose that $f: G → G'$ is a homomorphism. ⦉

  ‖ If $f$ is invertible then we call $f$ an ❬isomorphism❭ (or
    ❬monoid isomorphism❭). ⦉

  ‖ If the groups are identical, then we call $f$ an
    ❬automorphism❭ (or ❬monoid automorphism❭). ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Every endomorphism is a homomorphism. ⦉

  ‖ Similarly, every automorphism is an isomorphism. ⦉

  ‖ The endomorphisms and automorphisms are the homomorphisms and
    isomorphisms for which the groups are identical. ⦉
⦉

§§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $(G, ·)$ is a monoid and $x ∈ G$. ⦉

  ‖ Consider the additive monoid $(𝗡, +)$ of natural numbers
    under natural addition. ⦉

  ‖ The function $f: 𝗡 → G$ defined by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ f(n) = x^n \quad \text{for all } n ∈ 𝗡 ⦉
    ⦉
    is a homomorphism. ⦉

  ‖ The right hand side is defined in the sheet␣
    <a href='/sheets/monoid_products.html'>
      ‖ Monoid Products ⦉
    </a>
    . ⦉

  ‖ To verify this, first observe that $0$ is the unit in $(𝗡,
    +)$. ⦉

  ‖ And $f(0) = e$ by definition. ⦉

  ‖ Next, let $m, n ∈ 𝗡$, then
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ f(m+n) = x^{m+n} ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ We have seen that the right hand side is equivalent to
    $x^mx^n$, and hence, to $f(m)f(n)$, as desired. ⦉
