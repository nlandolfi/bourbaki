\section*{Definition}

A vector is \t{normalized} if its norm is 1.
A set of vectors $\set{u_1, \dots , u_k}$ \t{orthogonal} if $u_i^\top  u_j = 0$ whenever $i \neq j$.
A set of vectors is \t{orthonormal} if the set is orthogonal and each vector is normalized.

\section*{Basis}

An orthonormal set of vectors is also an independent set.
In other words, orthonormality is stronger than independence.
