§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ In general, a dataset may be both incomplete and
    inconsistent. ⦉
⦉

§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(Z, 𝒵)$ be a measurable space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $ℳ(Z, 𝒵)$ be the set of measures over $(Z, 𝒵)$. ⦉

  ‖ A ❬probabilistic inductor❭ for a dataset in $Z^n$ is a
    function mapping $Z^n$ to $ℳ(Z, 𝒵)$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $(Z, 𝒵) = (X × Y, 𝒳 × 𝒴)$ for measurable spaces
    $(X, 𝒳)$ and $(Y, 𝒴)$. ⦉

  ‖ Then a probabilistic inductor yields a probabilistic
    functional inductor. ⦉

  ‖ The conditional measure on $Y$ given an observation $x ∈ X$
    is exactly a family of measures indexed by $X$. ⦉
