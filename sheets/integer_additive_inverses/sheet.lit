§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ What is the additive inverse of $\eqc{(a, b)}$ in the
    integers? ⦉
⦉

§ Result ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ The additive inverse of $\eqc{(a, b)} ∈ 𝗭$ is $\eqc{(b,
    a)}$. ⦉
</statement>

‖ The additive inverse of $a ∈ 𝗭$ is sometimes called the
  ❬opposite❭ of $a$. ⦉

<!-- see Math. Cont. Meth. Meaning Vol III p 298-->

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the additive inverse of $z ∈ 𝗭$ by $-z$. ⦉

  ‖ We denote $a + (- b)$ by $a - b$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Subtraction ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We call the operation $(a, b) ↦ a - b$ ❬subtraction❭. ⦉
