§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ How many ways are there to split $n$ objects into
    nonoverlapping groups, when the objects are indistinguishable? ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $n$ is a nonzero natural number. ⦉

  ‖ A ❬partition❭ of $n$ is a ‹nonincreasing› list of ‹nonzero›
    natural numbers whose sum is $n$. ⦉

  ‖ The requirement that the list of numbers be nonincreasing
    makes the representation unique. ⦉

  ‖ The terms of the list are called the ❬parts❭ of the
    partition. ⦉

  ‖ The number $n$ is sometimes called the ❬weight❭ of the
    partition. ⦉

  ‖ The number of times a particular number appears in the list
    is called the ❬multiplicity❭ of that part. ⦉
⦉

§§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ What are the partitions of the number 5?
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \begin{aligned} ⦉

      ‖ 5 ⦉

      ‖ ＆= 5 ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ ＆= 4 + 1 ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ ＆= 3 + 2 ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ ＆= 3 + 1 + 1 ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ ＆= 2 + 2 + 1 ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ ＆= 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ ＆= 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 ⦉

      ‖ \end{aligned} ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ These seven identities correspond to the seven partitions of
    5, namely $(5,)$, $(4, 1)$, $(3, 2)$, $(3,1,1)$, $(2,2,1)$,
    $(2,1,1,1)$, $(1,1,1,1,1)$. ⦉

  ‖ The multiplicity of 1 in these partitions is 0, 1, 0, 2,
    1, 3, 5, respectively. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $λ$ is a list in $𝗡$ of length $r ≥ 1$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $λ = (λ_1, …, λ_r)$ is a ‹partition› of $n ∈ 𝗡$ if
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ λ_1 + λ_2 + ⋯ + λ_r = n ⦉
    ⦉
    and $λ_1 ≥ λ_2 ≥ ⋯ ≥ λ_r$. ⦉

  ‖ The terms of $λ$ are the ‹parts› of the partition, so
    $λ_i$ is the $i$th part, where $i = 1, …, r$. ⦉

  ‖ Some authors denote the ‹weight› of $λ$ by $\num{λ}$. ⦉
⦉

§ Partition function ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ How many partitions are there of the number $n$? ⦉

  ‖ We denote ‹this number› by $p(n).$ ⦉

  ‖ From the examples above, $p(5) = 7$. ⦉
