§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We abstract the properties of the natural numbers under
    natural addition and multiplication. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬semiring❭ $(S, +, ·)$ satisfies all the properties of a
    ring (see␣
    <a href='/sheets/rings.html'>
      ‖ Rings ⦉
    </a>
    ) ‹except› that addition $+$ need not have additive inverses. ⦉
⦉

§§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  <!-- TODO: check these! -->

  ‖ ‹Set of natural numbers.› ⦉

  ‖ The set $(𝗡, +, ·)$ where $+$ and $·$ denote natural
    addition and multiplication respectively is a semiring. ⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ ‹Nonnegative real numbers with max and multiplication› ⦉

  ‖ Notice that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \max(a, b) = \max(b, a) \quad \text{for all } a, b ∈ 𝗥 ⦉
    ⦉
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \max(a, \max(b, c)) = \max(\max(a, b), c) \quad \text{for
        all } a, b, c ∈ 𝗥 ⦉
    ⦉
    So $\max: 𝗥^2 → 𝗥$ is a commutative and associative
    operation. ⦉

  ‖ The identity is $0$, $\max(a, 0) = a$ for all $a ∈ 𝗥_+$. ⦉

  ‖ Notice that there is no inverse element. ⦉

  ‖ Of course, $·$ is associative and has identities. ⦉
