\section*{Why}

We abstract the properties of the natural numbers under natural addition and multiplication.

\section*{Definition}

A \t{semiring} $(S, +, \cdot )$ satisfies all the properties of a ring (see \sheetref{rings}{Rings}) \textit{except} that addition $+$ need not have additive inverses.

\subsection*{Examples}


% TODO: check these! 

\textit{Set of natural numbers.}
The set $(\N  , +, \cdot )$ where $+$ and $\cdot $ denote natural addition and multiplication respectively is a semiring.

\textit{Nonnegative real numbers with max and multiplication}
Notice that
\[
\max(a, b) = \max(b, a) \quad \text{for all } a, b \in \R
\]
\[
\max(a, \max(b, c)) = \max(\max(a, b), c) \quad \text{for all } a, b, c \in \R
\]
So $\max: \R ^2 \to \R $ is a commutative and associative operation.
The identity is $0$, $\max(a, 0) = a$ for all $a \in \R _+$.
Notice that there is no inverse element.
Of course, $\cdot $ is associative and has identities.
