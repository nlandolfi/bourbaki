§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We name and discuss the topological sigma algebra on the
    real numbers; the language and results generalize to $𝗥^d$. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬Borel sigma algebra❭ is the topological sigma algebra
    for the real numbers with the usual topology; we call its
    members the ❬Borel sets❭. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the Borel sigma algebra on $𝗥^d$ by $ℬ(𝗥^d)$. ⦉

  ‖ We denote $ℬ(𝗥^1)$ by $ℬ(𝗥)$. ⦉
⦉

§ Alternate Generations ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The Borel sigma algebra is useful because it contains
    interesting sets besides the open sets. ⦉

  ‖ To make precise this statement, we show that the Borel
    sigma algebra is generated by, and therefore contains, other
    common subsets of $R$. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ If a sigma algebra $𝒜$ includes a particular set of subsets
    $ℬ$, then $𝒜$ includes $σ(ℬ)$. ⦉

  ‖ Each of

      ‣ ‖ the collection of all closed subsets of $\R$, ⦉⦉

      ‣ ‖ the collection of all subintervals of $\R$ of the form $(-∞,
          b]$, ⦉⦉

      ‣ ‖ the collection of all subintervals of $\R$ of the form $(a,
          b]$, ⦉⦉

</statement>
<proof>
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Denote the sigma algebra which corresponds to (1) by
      $ℬ_1$, that which corresponds to (2) by $ℬ_2$, and that
      which corresponds to (3) by $ℬ_3$. ⦉

    ‖ It suffices to establish $ℬ(R) ⊂ ℬ_3 ⊂ ℬ_2 ⊂ ℬ_1 ⊂
      ℬ(R)$. ⦉
  ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Start with $ℬ_1$. ⦉

    ‖ Closed sets are the complement of open sets. ⦉

    ‖ Thus $ℬ(𝗥)$ contains all closed sets and so contains the
      sigma algebra generated by all closed sets, namely $ℬ_1$. ⦉
  ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Next, $ℬ_2$. ⦉

    ‖ The intervals $(-∞, b])$ are closed. ⦉

    ‖ Thus $ℬ_1$ contains all such intervals, and so contains
      the sigma algebra generated by such intervals, namely $ℬ_2$. ⦉
  ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Next, $ℬ_3$. ⦉

    ‖ An interval $(a, b]$ is $(-∞, b) ∩ C_R((-∞, a])$. ⦉

    ‖ Thus, all such intervals are contained in $ℬ_2$, and so
      $ℬ_2$ contains the sigma algebra generated by all such
      intervals, namely, $ℬ_3$. ⦉
  ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Each open interval of $R$ is the union of a sequence of
      sets $(a, b]$; namely $(a, b-1/n]$. ⦉

    ‖ So $ℬ_3$ contains all open intervals $(a, b)$. ⦉

    ‖ Each open set of $R$ can be written as a countable union
      of open intervals.
      † ⦊
        ‖ Future editions will include a proof. ⦉
      ⦉⦉

    ‖ Thus, $ℬ_3$ contains all open sets, and therefore contains
      the sigma algebra generated by the open subsets, namely
      $ℬ(R)$. ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ The complement of open sets are closed. ⦉

    ‖ Closed half spaces are closed. ⦉

    ‖ A strip of the form $\Set{(x_1, …, x_d)}{a_i < x_i ≤

    ‖ Each rectangle in (c) is the union of $d$ such strips.
      † ⦊
