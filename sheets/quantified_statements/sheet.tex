\s{Why}

We want symbols for talking about some object of a set or all objets of a set.
% existence of an object in a set and for the property that all objects of a set.
% and for the property that all object of a set satisfy some property.

\s{Definition}

\ss{Existential Quantifier}

Consider the symbol $\exists$.
We agree that it means \say{there exists an object}.
We write $\exists a \in A$.
We read this as \say{there exists an object in the set denoted by $A$, and denote that very same object by $a$}.
% For \say{there exists an object and we denote that very object by $a$} by $\exists a$.
% We want to say that there exists an object.
% Denote that object by $a$.
We call $\exists$ the existential quantifier.

\ss{Universal Quantifier}

Consider the symbol $\forall$.
We agree that it means \say{for every object}.
We write $\forall a \in A$.
We read this as \say{for every object in the set denoted by $A$, and denote one such object by $a$}.
