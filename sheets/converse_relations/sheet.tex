\section*{Why}

If $x$ is related to $y$, the $y$ is related to $x$, but how?

\section*{Definition}

If $R$ is a relation between $X$ and $Y$, then the \t{converse} or \t{inverse} relation of $R$ is a relation on $Y$ and $X$ relating $y \in Y$ to $x \in X$ if and only if $x\,R\,y$.
If $R = R^{-1}$ then $R$ is symmetric.

\section*{Notation}

We denote the converse relation of $R$ by $R^{-1}$.

\section*{Example}

Let $X$ be the set of people and let $R$ be a relation in $X$.
If $R$ is \say{is a father of}, then $R^{-1}$ is \say{is a son of}.
If $R$ is \say{is a mother of}, then $R^{-1}$ is \say{is a daughter of}.
If $R$ is \say{is a brother of}, then $R^{-1}$ is \say{is a brother of}.
The relation \say{is a brother of} is symmetric.
