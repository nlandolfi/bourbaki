§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Here are a few questions, which turn out to be related. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ (1) What is the smallest convex set containing a given
    (possibly nonconvex) set $A ⊂ 𝗥^n$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ (2) Suppose we want to describe the set of points a
    rectangle in the plane. ⦉

  ‖ It seems natural that we should be able to do so by
    specifying the four vertices $v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4 ∈ 𝗥^2$, and
    then saying, roughly that the points in of any of these
    vertices, or any point on a segment between these two points
    is in the rectangle. ⦉

  ‖ Define a function $κ: \powerset{𝗥^2} → \powerset{𝗥^2}$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ κ(A) = ∪_{x, y ∈ A} [a, b] ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Then
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ κ(\set{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4}) = ⦉

      ‖ ∪ [v_1, v_2] ∪ [v_1, v_3] ∪ [v_1, v_4] ⦉

      ‖ ∪ [v_2, v_3] ∪ [v_2, v_4] ⦉

      ‖ ∪ [v_3, v_4] ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Then it is natural to say $S_1 ⊂ R$. ⦉

  ‖ Are there points not in $S_1$ but in $R$? ⦉

  ‖ Sure, all the points on the red line. ⦉

  </center>

  ‖ So consider a convex combination of two of them, say
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ u_1 = v_1 + α(v_2 - v_1) \quad \text{ and } \quad u_2
        = v_3 + β(v_2 - v_3) ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Now pick a $λ ∈ [0,1]$ and form
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \begin{aligned} ⦉

      ‖ λu_1 + (1-λ)u_2 ⦉

      ‖ &= λ(1-α)v_1 + λαv_2 + (1-λ)(1-β)v_2 + (1-λ)βv_3 \\ ⦉

      ‖ &= λ(1-α)v_1 + (λα + (1-λ)(1-β))v_2 + (1-λ)βv_3 ⦉

      ‖ \end{aligned} ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Notice that each of the coefficients on $v_1, v_2, v_3$ are
    nonnegative. ⦉

  ‖ Moreover, notice that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ λ(1-α) + λα + (1-λ)(1-β) + (1-λ)β = λ + (1-λ) = 1 ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ In other words, the points on the line segment between
    $u_1$ and $u_2$ are points which can be written as a sum
    of the vertices of the square, scaled by nonnegative
    coefficients which sum to one. ⦉

  ‖ A natural question is: does $R = κ(κ(S))$? ⦉
⦉

§ Definitions ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬convex combination❭ is a linear combination whose sequence
    of scalars is nonnegative and sums to one. ⦉

  ‖ Given any set $A ⊂ 𝗥^n$, the convex hull of $A$ is ⦉
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ And

      ‖ What is the smallest convex

        ‖ Suppose we want to describe a rectangle in the plane. ⦉

        ‖ We can give its four verices $v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4 ∈
          𝗥^2$ and then say that the set we speak of the set
          of all line ⦉

        ‖ segments between the two points. ⦉⦉

      ‖ Suppose we take some points in

        ‖ What is the smallest convex set containing a given
          (possibly nonconvex) set? ⦉

        ‖ Alternatively, given some points $x_1, …, x_n ∈ 𝗥^d$,
          can ⦉

        § Definition ⦉
        ¶ ⦊
          ‖ We have seen that convex sets are closed under
            intersection. ⦉

          ‖ Clearly $𝗥^n$ is a convex set. ⦉

          ‖ So the set of convex sets in $𝗥^n$ containing $A ⊂
            𝗥^n$ has at least one member. ⦉

          ‖ The ❬convex hull❭ (or ❬real convex hull❭) of a set
            $A ⊂ 𝗥^n$ is the intersection of all convex sets
            containing the set. ⦉

          ‖ In other words, it is the smallest convex set
            containing $A$. ⦉
        ⦉

        §§ Notation ⦉
        ¶ ⦊
          ‖ We denote the convex hull of $S ⊂ 𝗥^n$ by $\conv
            S$. ⦉
        ⦉

        § Characterization ⦉
        <statement type='proposition'>
          ‖ Let $S ⊂ 𝗥^n$. $\conv S$ is the set of all convex
            combinations of elements of $S$. ⦉

          ‖ The convex hull of $\set{b_1, …, b_m} ⊂ 𝗥^n$
            consists of all vectors
