§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬convex hull❭ (or ❬real convex hull❭) of a set $A ⊂
    𝗥^n$ is the intersection of all convex sets containing the
    set. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, it is the smallest convex set containing
    $A$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the convex hull of $S ⊂ 𝗥^n$ by $\conv S$. ⦉
⦉

§ Characterization ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Let $S ⊂ 𝗥^n$. $\conv S$ is the set of all convex
    combinations of elements of $S$. ⦉
