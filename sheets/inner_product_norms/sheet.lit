§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ To every real-valued inner product there corresponds a norm,
    in a similar manner to the construction for $𝗥^n$. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ \begin{prop} ⦉

  ‖ Let $(V, 𝗙)$ be a vector space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $f: V × V → 𝗙$ be an inner product with $f(x, x) ∈
    𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $g: V → 𝗥$ such that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ g(x) = √{f(x, x)}. ⦉
    ⦉

    ‖ Then $g$ is a norm. ⦉

    ‖ \end{prop} ⦉⦉
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ The ❬norm❭ of a vector in an inner product space is the
      square root of the inner product of the vector with itself. ⦉
