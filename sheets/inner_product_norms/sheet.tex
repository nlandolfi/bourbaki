\ssection{Why}

An inner product gives
rise to a norm naturally.

\ssection{Definition}

Let $R$ be the set of real numbers
and $C$ be the set of complex numbers.

\begin{prop}
Let $(V, C)$ be a complex
vector space.
Let $f$ be an inner product on
$(V, C)$.
Let $g: V \to R$ such that
\[
  g(x) = \sqrt{f(x, x)}.
\]
Then $g$ is a norm.
\end{prop}

The norm of a vector
in an inner product space
is the square root of the
inner product of the vector
with itself.
