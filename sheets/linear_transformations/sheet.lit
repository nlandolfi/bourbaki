§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Many functions of interest are additive and homogenous. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A transformation is ❬linear❭ (a ❬linear transformation❭,
    ❬linear map❭) if the result of a linear combination of the
    two vectors is the linear combination of the results of the
    vectors (using the same coefficients). ⦉

  ‖ The transformation is linear ❬with respect to❭ the field of
    the two vector spaces. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We use the term transformation (see␣
    <a href='/sheets/transformations.html'>
      ‖ Transformations ⦉
    </a>
    ) for emphasis and reminder that the function is defined on
    a vector space. ⦉

  ‖ Of course, $𝗥$ is a vector space and so a function $f: 𝗥
    → 𝗥$ may be linear. ⦉

  ‖ The linear maps from $𝗥$ to $𝗥$ are the the ❬linear
    functions❭ (see␣
    <a href='/sheets/real_linear_functions.html'>
      ‖ Real Linear Functions ⦉
    </a>
    ) . ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Often authors will use the word ❬operator❭ for linear
    functions. ⦉

  ‖ It seems, generally, that this term is commonly reserved for
    the case in which the vector space discussed is a function
    space (or, at least, infinite dimensional). ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(V, 𝗙)$ and $(W, 𝗙)$ be two vector spaces over the
    same field. ⦉

  ‖ Suppose $T: V → W$. ⦉

  ‖ $T$ is linear means
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ T(αu + βv) = βT(u) + αT(v) \quad \text{for all } α, β
        ∈ F \text{ and } u, v ∈ V. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ As usual, the condition that $T$ is linear condition is
    equivalent to the two conditions:
    𝍫 ⦊
      ‣ $T(u + v) = f(u) + T(v)$ for all $u, v ∈ V$, and ⦉

      ‣ $f(λu) = λf(u)$ for all $λ ∈ 𝗙$ and $u ∈ V$. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ If $T$ satisfies (1), we call $T$ ❬additive❭ (has the
    property of ❬additivity❭) and if it satisfies (2) we call
    $T$ $T$ ❬homogeneous❭ (has the property of ❬homogeneity❭). ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ For linear maps, it is common to denote $T(v)$ by $Tv$;
    notice that we have dropped the usual parentheses. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the set of all linear maps by $ℒ(V, W)$. ⦉

  ‖ It is understood when using this notation that $V$ and $W$
    are vector spaces with respect to the same field $𝗙$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Throughout, we consider vector spaces $V$ and $W$ over some
    fixed field $𝗙$. ⦉

    ⦉
    is called the ❬zero map❭ (or ❬zero transformation❭). ⦉

  ‖ It is common to overload the symbol 0 so that $0 ∈ ℒ(V,
    W)$ denotes the map zero map. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, the map $0$ is defined by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ 0v = 0 ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Some care is required to interpret this equation. ⦉

  ‖ The 0 on the left hand side refers to a function, from
    $V$ to $W$. ⦉

  ‖ The 0 on the right hand side is the additive identity in
    $W$. ⦉

  ‖ Usually context disambiguates the overloaded notation. ⦉
⦉

    = λ∫f$ whenever $f, g$ are differentiable and $λ ∈ 𝗥$ (see␣
