§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Lots of things are (approximately) linear.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will expand on this why. In particular,
        the intuition of proportionality. ⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A transformation is ❬linear❭ if the result of a linear
    combination of the two vectors is the linear combination of
    the results of the vectors (using the same coefficients). ⦉

  ‖ The transformation is linear ❬with respect to❭ the field of
    the two vector spaces. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We use the term transformation (
    <a href='/sheets/transformations.html'>
      ‖ Transformations ⦉
    </a>
    ) for emphasis and reminder that the function is defined on
    a vector space. ⦉

  ‖ Of course, $𝗥$ is a vector space and so a function $f: 𝗥
    → 𝗥$ may be linear. ⦉

  ‖ It is, therefore, common to speak of ❬linear functions❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Often authors will use the word ❬operator❭ for linear
    functions. ⦉

  ‖ It seems, generally, that this term is commonly reserved for
    the case in which the vector space discussed is a function
    space (or, at least, infinite dimensional). ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(V_1, F)$ and $(V_2, F)$ be two vector spaces over
    the same field. ⦉

  ‖ Let $f: V_1 → V_2$. $f$ is linear means
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ f(au + bv) = af(u) + bf(v) ⦉
    ⦉
    for all $a, b ∈ F$ and $u, v ∈ V_1$. ⦉
