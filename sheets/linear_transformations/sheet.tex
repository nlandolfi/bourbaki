\ssection{Definition}

An \t{linear transformation} is a transformation which maps is if a linear combination if the result of a linear combination of two vectors in the first space is the linear combination (with the same coefficients) of the result in the second space.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(V_1, F)$
and $(V_2, F)$ be two
vector spaces over the
same field.
Let $f: V_1 \to V_2$.
$f$ is linear means
\[
  f(au + bv) = af(u) + bf(v)
\]
for all $a, b \in F$ and $u, v \in V_1$.
