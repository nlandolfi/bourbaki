\ssection{Why}

How to select distribution graphs.\footnote{Future editions will modify.}

\ssection{Definition}

Let $(G, A)$ be a typed graph on $\set{1, \dots, n}$.
Let $S \subset \set{1, \dots, n}$.
Let $x^1, \dots, x^n$ be a dataset in $A_S = \prod_{j \in S} A_j$ (see \sheetref{function_graphs}{Function Graphs}).
The \t{observation likelihood} for this dataset is the observation distribution likelihood of the dataset $\prod_{i =1}^{n} p_S(x^i)$.

A \t{maximum likelihood distribution graph} is one that maximizes the observation likelihood.
The maximum likelihood distribution graph with respect to a parametric distribution family is the member of the family that maximizes the observation likelihood.
