\ssection{Why}
What is a reasonable normal density to associate with some data?

\ssection{Definition}

Let $x^1, \dots, x^n$ be a dataset in $\R^d$.
The \t{empirical mean} of the dataset is
  \[
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{k = 1}^{n} x^k.
  \]
The \t{empirical covariance} of the dataset is
  \[
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} (x^k - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k = 1}^{n} x^k) (x^k - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k = 1}^{n} x^k)^{\tp}.
  \]
The \t{empirical normal} associated with the dataset is the normal density whose mean is the empirical mean and whose covariance is the empirical covariance.
