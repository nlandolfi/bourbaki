§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ What is a reasonable normal density to associate with some
    data? ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $x^1, …, x^n$ be a dataset in $𝗥^d$. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬empirical mean❭ of the dataset is the real number
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \frac{1}{n} ∑_{k = 1}^{n} x^k. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ The ❬empirical covariance❭ of the dataset is the real matrix
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \frac{1}{n} ∑_{i = 1}^{n} (x^k - \frac{1}{n} ∑_{k =
        1}^{n} x^k) (x^k - \frac{1}{n} ∑_{k = 1}^{n} x^k)^⊤. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ The ❬empirical normal density❭ (or ❬empirical normal❭)
    associated with the dataset is the normal density whose mean
    is the empirical mean and whose covariance is the empirical
    covariance. ⦉
