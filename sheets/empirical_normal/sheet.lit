§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ What is a reasonable normal density to associate with some
    data? ⦉

⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $x^1, …, x^n$ be a dataset in $𝗥^d$. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬empirical mean❭ of the dataset is
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \frac{1}{n} ∑_{k = 1}^{n} x^k. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ The ❬empirical covariance❭ of the dataset is
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \frac{1}{n} ∑_{i = 1}^{n} (x^k - \frac{1}{n} ∑_{k =
        1}^{n} x^k) (x^k - \frac{1}{n} ∑_{k = 1}^{n} x^k)^{\tp}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ The ❬empirical normal❭ associated with the dataset is the
    normal density whose mean is the empirical mean and whose
    covariance is the empirical covariance. ⦉
