\section*{Why}

Since every affine set is a translate of some (unique) subspace, it is natural to define the dimension of an affine set as the dimension of this subspace.

\section*{Definition}

The \t{dimension} of a nonempty affine set is the dimension of the subspace parallel to it.
By convention, $\varnothing$ has dimension $-1$.
Naturally, the \t{points}, \t{lines} and \t{planes} are affine sets of dimension 0, 1, and 2 respectively.
