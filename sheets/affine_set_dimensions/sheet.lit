§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Since every affine set is a translate of some (unique)
    subspace, it is natural to define the dimension of an affine
    set as the dimension of this subspace. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬dimension❭ of a nonempty affine set is the dimension
    of the subspace parallel to it. ⦉

  ‖ By convention, $∅$ has dimension $-1$. ⦉

  ‖ Naturally, the ❬points❭, ❬lines❭ and ❬planes❭ are affine sets
    of dimension 0, 1, and 2 respectively. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ If an affine set has dimension $r$, then we often call it
    an ❬$r$-flat❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ For any $S ⊂ 𝗥^n$, we define the dimension of $A$ to be
    the dimension of the affine hull of $A$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the dimension of the set $S ⊂ 𝗥^n$ by $\dim S$ ⦉

  ‖ We have defined it so that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \dim S = \dim \aff S ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ This makes sense if $S$ is affine, since in this case
    $\aff S = S$. ⦉
⦉

§ Result ⦉
<statement type="proposition">
  ‖ Any $r$-flat has $r+1$ affinely independent points. ⦉

  ‖ Each of its sets of size $r+2$ are affinely dependent. ⦉
