\ssection{Why}

\ssection{Definition}

A \t{rotate scale rotate decomposition} (or \t{rotate scale rotate factorization}) of a matrix $A \in \R^{m \times n}$ is an ordered triple $(U, S, V)$ where $U$ and $V$ are orthgonal and $S$ is diagonal and
\[
  A = US\transpose{V}
\]
This is universally known as the \t{singular value decomposition} or \t{SVD} of $A$.
We call diagonal elements of $S$ the \t{singular values} of $A$.
We call the column vectors of $U$ the \t{left singular vectors} or \t{output singular vectors}.
We call the column vectors of $V$ the \t{right singular vectors} or \t{input singular vectors}.
We refer to them collectively as the \t{singular vectors}.
\[
  Av_i = \sigma_i u_i.
