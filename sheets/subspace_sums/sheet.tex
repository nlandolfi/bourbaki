\section*{Definition}

The \t{sum} of two subspaces is the span of their union.
So then the sum of two subspaces is also a subspace.
If the intersection of two subspaces is the zero subspace, we call the sum a \t{direct sum}.

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $U$ and $V$ be subspaces of a vector space.
We denote the sum of $U$ and $V$ by $U + V$.
We can express
\[
U+V = \span (U+V).
\]
If $S_1 \cap  S_2 = \set{0}$
