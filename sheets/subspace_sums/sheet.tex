\ssection{Why}

\ssection{Definition}

The \t{sum} of two subspaces is the span of their union.
So then the sum of two subspaces is also a subspace.
If the intersection of two subspaces is the zero subspace, we call the sum a \t{direct sum}.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $U$ and $V$ be subspaces of a vector space.
We denote the sume of $U$ and $V$ by $U + V$.
We can express
$$
  U+V = \span (U+V).
$$
Let $\mathbfsf{0}$ denote the zero vector.
If $S_1 \intersect S_2 = \set{\mathbfsf{0}}$

TODO: something about uniqueness of representation
