\section*{Why}

We want to visualize the probabilistic relations between components of outcomes in probabilistic models over large (e.g., product) outcome sets.\footnote{Future editions will modify and expand. The title of the sheet may change, since another interpretation for the words \say{directed graph distribution} is a distribution on directed graphs.}

\section*{Definition}

Suppose $X_1, \dots , X_k$ are sets and define $X = \prod_{i = 1}^k X_i$.
For $x \in X$ and $S \subset \set{1, \dots , n}$, denote the subvector of $x$ indexed (in order) by $S$ by $x_S$.\footnote{Future editions will rework this treatment, perhaps combining it with the sheet \sheetref{index_matrices}{Index Matrices}, which will possibly be split up.}

A distribution $p: X \to [0, 1]$ \t{factors according to a directed graph} on $\set{1, \dots , n}$ with parent function $\pa: \set{1,\dots ,n} \to \powerset{\set{1, \dots , n}}$ if
    \[
p(x) = \prod_{\pa_i = \varnothing} g_i(x_i) \prod_{\pa_i \neq \varnothing} g_{i}(x_i, x_{\pa_i}),
    \]
where $g_i$ is a distribution for all $i$ which $\pa_i = \varnothing$ and $g_{i}(\cdot , \xi )$ is a distribution for all $\xi  \in \prod_{j \in \pa_i} A_j$, $i$ for which $\pa_i \neq \varnothing$.

\begin{proposition}
$p$ so defined is a distribution, and the $g_i$ are the marginals and conditionals.\footnote{Future editions will be precise and give an account.}\end{proposition}
\section*{Examples}

Consider a rooted tree distribution (see \sheetref{rooted_tree_distributions}{Rooted Tree Distributions}), or a memory chain (see \sheetref{memory_chains}{Memory Chains}), or a hidden memory chain (see \sheetref{hidden_memory_chains}{Hidden Memory Chains}).\footnote{Future editions will expand.}
