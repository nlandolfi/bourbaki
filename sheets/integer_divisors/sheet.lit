§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $a$ is an integer. ⦉

  ‖ A ❬divisor❭ of $a$ is another integer $b$ for which there
    exists an integer $k$ satisfying
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ a = kb ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ In this case, we say that $b$ ❬divides❭ $a$ or that $a$
    is ❬divisible by❭ $b$. ⦉

  ‖ Often, we specialize to the case in which all the integers
    involved are positive, but the definition we give here also
    allows for some to be negative. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose that $c ∈ 𝗭$ does not divide $a$ and that $a$ is
    positive. ⦉

  ‖ Denote by $k$ the largest integer satisfying
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ kc < a ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Define $r = a - kc$. ⦉

  ‖ We call $r > 0$ the ❬remainder❭ of dividing $a$ into $b$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ For $a, b ∈ 𝗭$ we denote that $b$ divides $a$ by writing
    $b | a$. ⦉

  ‖ For $c ∈ 𝗭$, we denote that $c$ does not divide $a$ by
    $c \not| a$. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the remainder of dividing $c$ into $a$ by $a
    \mod c$. ⦉
