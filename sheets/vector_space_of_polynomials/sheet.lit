§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $𝗙$ is a field. ⦉

  ‖ A function $p: 𝗙 → 𝗙$ is called a ❬polynomial❭ with
    coefficients in $𝗙$ if there exist $a_0, a_1, …, a_m ∈ 𝗙$
    (for some $m ∈ 𝗡$) such that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ p(z) = a_0 + a_1z + a_2z^2 + ⋯ + a_mz^m \quad
        \text{for all } z ∈ 𝗙 ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ The set of all polynomials with coefficients in $𝗙$ is a
    subspace of the vector space of all function $𝗙^𝗙$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The set of all polynomials in $𝗙$ is sometimes denoted by
    $𝗣(𝗙)$ or $𝒫(𝗙)$. ⦉
