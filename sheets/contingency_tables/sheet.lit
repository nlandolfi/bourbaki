§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to summarize the interaction between two binary
    traits. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬contingency table❭ of a population $\set{1,…,n}$ with
    respect to binary traits $a, b : \upto{n} → \set{0,1}$ is
    the array $A ∈ 𝗡^{2 × 2}$ of natural numbers defined by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ A = \barray{ ⦉

      ‖ \num{a^{-1}(0) ∩ b^{-1}(0)} & \num{a^{-1}(0) ∩ b^{-1}(1)} ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ \num{a^{-1}(1) ∩ b^{-1}(0)} & \num{a^{-1}(0) ∩ b^{-1}(1)} ⦉

      ‖ }. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ We interpret $A_{11}$ as the number of individuals which
    have neither trait, $A_{12}$ as the individuals which have
    trait $b$ but not trait $a$, and so on. ⦉
⦉

§ Normalization ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ These four sets partition $\upto{n}$, so that if we divide
    the elements by $n$, we obtain four numbers which sum to 1,
    the 2 by 2 table with these entries is called the
    ❬normalized contingency table❭. ⦉
⦉

§ Contingency arrays ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ In general, we have $k$ binary traits, each of which an
    individual may or may not have. ⦉

  ‖ We encode these traits using $k$ functions
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ a_1, …, a_k: \upto{n} → \set{0,1}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ The contingency array is $k$-dimensional array $A$, with
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ A_x = ∩_{j = 1}^{k} a_j^{-1}(x_j), ⦉
    ⦉
    where $x ∈ \set{0,1}^k$. ⦉
