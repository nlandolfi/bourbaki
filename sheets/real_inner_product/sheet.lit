§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to measure angles in space.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will expand, and perhaps give the
        development for $𝗥^2$ first. ⦉

      ‖ Future editions will include pictures. ⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬real inner product❭ (or ❬dot product❭, ❬scalar product❭)
    of two real vectors $x, y ∈ 𝗥^n$ is
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ x_1y_1 + x_2y_2 + ⋯ + x_ny_n ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ We denote the inner product of $x$ and $y$ by $\ip{x,y}$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Properties ⦉
¶ ⦊

  ‖ The inner product has several important properties
    𝍫 ⦊
      ‣ $\ip{\alpha x, y} = \alpha\ip{x, y}$ ⦉

      ‣ $\ip{x + y, z} = \ip{x, z} + \ip{y, z}$ ⦉

      ‣ $\ip{x, y} = \ip{y, x}$ ⦉

      ‣ $\ip{x,x} ≥ 0$ ⦉

      ‣ $\ip{x,x} = 0 \iff x = 0$ ⦉

⦉

§§ Connection to norm ⦉
¶ ⦊

  ‖ It is important to note that $\norm{x} = \sqrt{\ip{x,x}}$. ⦉
