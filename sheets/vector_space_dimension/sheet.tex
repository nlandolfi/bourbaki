\ssection{Why}

We noticed that the
number of vectors in
any basis is the same.

\ssection{Definition}

Consider a vector space.

A vector space
is \ct{finite-dimensional}{}.
if it has a finite basis;
otherwise it is
it is \ct{infinite-dimensional}{}.

The \ct{dimension}{}
of a finite-dimensional
vector space is the number
of elements in any basis.
