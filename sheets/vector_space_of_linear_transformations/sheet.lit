§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Can we think of linear maps as vectors? ⦉
⦉

§ Definitions ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $V$ and $W$ are some vector spaces over a field
    $𝗙$. ⦉

  ‖ Denote the linear maps from $V$ to $W$ by $ℒ(V, W)$ as
    usual. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ ‹Addition.› ⦉

  ‖ Given $S, T ∈ ℒ(V, W)$ the ❬sum❭ of $S$ and $T$ is the
    linear map $R ∈ ℒ(V, W)$ defined by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ Rv = Sv + Tv \quad \text{for all } v ∈ V ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ ‹Scalar multiplication.› ⦉

  ‖ Given $S ∈ ℒ(V, W)$ the ❬(scalar) product❭ of $λ$ and $T$
    is the linear map $Q ∈ ℒ(V, W)$ defined by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ Qv = λTv \quad \text{for all } v ∈ V ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Suppose $V$ and $W$ are two vector spaces over the same
    field $𝗙$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $ℒ(V, W)$ is a vector space over the field $𝗙$ with
    respect to the operations of addition and scalar
    multiplication just defined. ⦉
</statement>
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The additive identity of the vector space $ℒ(V, W)$ is the
    zero map $0 ∈ ℒ(V, w)$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given $S, T ∈ ℒ(V, W)$ the ❬sum❭ of $S$ and $T$ and $λ
    ∈ 𝗙$, we denote the sum of $S$ and $T$ by $S + T$. ⦉

  ‖ Hence,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ (S + T)(v) = Sv + Tv \quad \text{for all } v ∈ V ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ We denote the product of $λ$ and $T$ by $λT$. ⦉

  ‖ Hence,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ (λT)(v) = λ(Tv) \quad \text{for all } v ∈ V ⦉
