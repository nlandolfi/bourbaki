\stitle{Graph Cliques}
\ssection{Why}

TODO
%We speak of the maximal complete subgraphs of a graph.

\ssection{Definition}

A
\ct{complete}{completegraph}
graph is one
for which an edge exists
between any two nodes.

A
\ct{subgraph}{subgraph}
of a given graph
is a graph whose
vertex set is a subset
of the given vertex set
and whose edge set is the
subset of given edges connecting
vertices in the vertex subset.
With reference to the underling
graph, then, a subgraph can be
specified completely by its
vertex set.

A \ct{clique}{clique}
of a given graph
is a complete subgraph
of that graph.
When speaking of the cliques
of a given graph, we identify
the cliques with their vertex
set.
The relation contained in
gives a partial order on
cliques.
A clique is
\ct{maximal}{maximal}
if it maximal with
respect to this relation;
i.e., it is contained
in no other clique.
As a convention, we include
$\emptyset$ as a clique.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(V, E)$ a graph.
We denote a clique
by $C \subset V$,
a mnemonic for clique.
