§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬orthogonal complement❭ of a subset of an inner product
    space is the set of vectors which are orthogonal to every
    vector in the subset. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Here is the definition in symbols. ⦉

  ‖ Given an inner product space $V$ and a ‹subset› $U ⊂ V$,
    the orthogonal complement of $V$ is
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \Set{v ∈ V}{\ip{v, u} = 0 \text{ for every } u ∈ U} ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the orthogonal complement of $U$ by $U^{\perp}$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ ‹Complements of lines and planes in $𝗥^3$.› ⦉

  ‖ If $U$ is a line in $𝗥^3$, then $U^⊥$ is the plane
    containing the origin that is perpendicular to $U$. ⦉

  ‖ Conversely, if $U$ is a plane in $𝗥^3$ containing the
    origin, then $U^⊥$ is the line containing the origin that is
    perpendicular to $U$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Properties ⦉

  ‖ Suppose $V$ is an inner product space. ⦉

    𝍫 ⦊
      ‣ $U^⊥$ is a subspace of $V$. ⦉

      ‣ $\set{0}^⊥ = V$ ⦉

      ‣ $V^⊥ = \set{0}$ ⦉

      ‣ $U ∩ U^⊥ ⊂ \set{0}$ ⦉

      ‣ if $W ⊂ U$, then $W^⊥ ⊂ U^⊥$ ⦉
