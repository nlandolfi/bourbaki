\section*{Definition}

The \t{orthogonal complement} of a subset of an inner product space is the set of vectors which are orthogonal to every vector in the subset.

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $(V, \F )$ be a vector space and $U \subset V$.
We denote the orthogonal complement of $U$ by $U^{\perp}$.
