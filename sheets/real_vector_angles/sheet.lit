§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We generalize the notion of angle between vectors in $𝗥^2$
    and $𝗥^3$ to vectors in $𝗥^n$. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬angle❭ (❬unsigned angle❭) between the nonzero vectors
    $x, y ∈ 𝗥^n$, is the real knumber
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ θ = ∠(x,y) = \cos^{-1} \frac{x^⊤ y}{\norm{x}\norm{y}}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ In the case that one (or both) of the vectors is zero, we
    define the angle between them to be 0. ⦉

  ‖ Thus, $x^⊤ y = \norm{x}\norm{y}\cosθ$, which is a convenient
    way to remember the inner product norm inequality. ⦉
⦉

§§ Terminology ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ $x$ and $y$ are ❬aligned❭ if $θ = 0$, in which case $x^⊤
    y = \norm{x}\norm{y}$. ⦉

  ‖ In the case that $x ≠ 0$, $x$ and $y$ are aligned if $x
    = αy$ for some $α ≥ 0$. ⦉

  ‖ $x$ and $y$ are ❬opposed❭ if $θ = π$, in which case $x^⊤
    y = \norm{x}\norm{y}$. ⦉

  ‖ In the case that $x ≠ 0$, $x$ and $y$ are opposed if $x
    = -αy$ for some $α ≥ 0$. ⦉

  ‖ Two nonnzero vectors $x$ and $y$ are ❬orthogonal❭ if $θ =
    π/2$ or $-π/2$, in which case $x^⊤ y = \norm{x}\norm{y}$. ⦉

  ‖ The origin is orthogonal to every other vector. ⦉

  ‖ We denote that two vectors $x$ and $y$ are orthogonal by
    $x ⊥ y$. ⦉
