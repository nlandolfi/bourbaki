§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We generalize the notion of a point in $𝗥$, a line in
    $𝗥^2$ and a plane in $𝗥^3$. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬hyperplane❭ is a $(n-1)$-dimensional affine set in $𝗥^n$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Discussion ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Since the $n-1$-dimensional subspaces are the orthogonal
    complements of the one-dimensional subspaces, they are the
    sets which can be specified by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \Set*{x ∈ 𝗥^n}{x ⊥ b} + a ⦉
    ⦉
    for $a, b ∈ 𝗥^n$. ⦉

  ‖ The hyperplanes are translates of these,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \begin{aligned} ⦉

      ‖ \Set*{x ∈ 𝗥^n}{x ⊥ b} + a ＆= \Set*{x + a}{\ip{x,b} =
        0} ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ ＆= \Set*{y}{\ip{y - a,b} = 0} = \Set*{y}{\ip{y,b} = β},
        ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ \end{aligned} ⦉
    ⦉
    where $β = \ip{a,b}$. ⦉
⦉

§ Characterization ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ $H ⊂ 𝗥^n$ is a hyperplane if and only if there exists $β
    ∈ 𝗥$ and ‹nonzero› $b ∈ 𝗥^n$ so that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ H = \Set*{x ∈ 𝗥^n}{\ip{x,b} = β}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
</statement>
<statement type='remark'>
  ‖ $b$ and $β$ are unique up to a common nonzero multiple. ⦉

  ‖ For example, $b, β$ and $2b, 2β$ give the same hyperplane. ⦉
</statement>
<statement type='remark'>
  ‖ Any such vector $b$ is called a ❬normal❭ (or ❬normal
    vector❭) to the hyperplane. ⦉
</statement>
<statement type='remark'>
  ‖ If $H$ is a hyperplane not containing the origin, then
    there is a unique unit vecor $u$ and $α > 0$ so that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ H = \Set{x ∈ 𝗥^n}{\ip{x,u} = α} ⦉
