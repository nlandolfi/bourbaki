\section*{Definition}

A \t{quadratic form} is a multivariate polynomial each term of which has degree two.

\section*{Representation}

Let $f: \R ^n \to \R $ be a quadratic form.
There exists a matrix $A \in \R ^{n \times  n}$ so that
    \[
x^\top  A x = \sum_{i,j} A_{ij}x_{i}x_{j}.
    \]
Suppose $A$ is not symmetric. Then
    \[
f(x) = f(x)/2 + f(x)/2 = \frac{1}{2}x^\top Ax + \frac{1}{2}x^\top A^\top x = x^\top (\frac{1}{2}(A + A^\top ))x.
    \]
Define $B = 1/2 (A^\top  + A)$.
We call $B$ the \t{symmetric part} of $A$.
Since every matrix $A$ has a symmetric part, we can always assume that the matrix for a quadratic form is symmetric.
If it is not, replace it with its symmetric part, obtaining the same function.

\section*{Under trace}

Observe that $\tr x^\top  A x = \tr A x x^\top  = \tr xx^\top A$.
