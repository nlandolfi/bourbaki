§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬quadratic form❭ is a multivariate polynomial each term of
    which has degree two. ⦉
⦉

§ Representation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $f: 𝗥^n → 𝗥$ be a quadratic form. ⦉

  ‖ There exists a matrix $A ∈ 𝗥^{n × n}$ so that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ x^⊤ A x = ∑_{i,j} A_{ij}x_{i}x_{j}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Suppose $A$ is not symmetric. Then
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ f(x) = f(x)/2 + f(x)/2 = \frac{1}{2}x^⊤Ax +
        \frac{1}{2}x^⊤A^⊤x = x^⊤(\frac{1}{2}(A + A^⊤))x. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Define $B = ½(A^⊤ + A)$. ⦉

  ‖ We call $B$ the ❬symmetric part❭ of $A$. ⦉

  ‖ Since every matrix $A$ has a symmetric part, we can always
    assume that the matrix for a quadratic form is symmetric. ⦉

  ‖ If it is not, replace it with its symmetric part, obtaining
    the same function. ⦉

§ Under trace ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Observe that $\tr x^⊤ A x = \tr A x x^⊤ = \tr xx^⊤A$. ⦉
