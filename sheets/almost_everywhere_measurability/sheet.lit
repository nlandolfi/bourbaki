§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Does convergence almost everywhere of a sequence of
    measurable functions guarantee measurability of the limit
    function? ⦉

  ‖ It does on complete measure spaces, and we can use this
    result to “weaken” the hypotheses of many theorems. ⦉
⦉

§ Results ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A measure is ❬complete❭ if every subset of a measurable set
    of measure zero is measurable. ⦉

  ‖ If the measure is complete, then every negligible set must
    be measurable. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We begin with a transitivity property: almost everywhere
    equality of two functions allows us to infer measurability of
    one from the other. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Suppose $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ is measure space and $f,g: X → [-∞,
    ∞]$ are such that $f = g$ almost everywhere. ⦉

  ‖ If $μ$ is complete and $f$ is $𝒜$-measurable, then $g$ is
    $𝒜$-measurable. ⦉
</statement>
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ be a measure space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $\seqt{f}: X → [-∞, ∞]$ for all ⦉

  ‖ natural numbers $n$ ⦉

  ‖ and $f: X → [-∞, ∞]$ ⦉

  ‖ with ⦉

  ‖ $\seq{f}$ converging to $f$ almost everywhere. ⦉

  ‖ If $μ$ is complete and ⦉

  ‖ and $\seqt{f}$ is measurable for each $n$, ⦉

  ‖ then $f$ is $𝒜$-measurable. ⦉
