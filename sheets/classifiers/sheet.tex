\ssection{Why}

Often the set of postcepts is a finite set, commonly with only two elements.

\ssection{Definition}

A \t{classifer} is a predictor whose codomain is a finite set.
In the case that we call the predictor a classifier, we call the postcepts \t{classes}.
We call the prediction of a classifer on a precept the \t{classification} of the precept.
