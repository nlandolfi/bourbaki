¬ß Why ‚¶â
¬∂ ‚¶ä
  ‚Äñ We often want to predict one of several outcomes. ‚¶â
‚¶â

¬ß Definition ‚¶â
¬∂ ‚¶ä
  ‚Äñ A ‚ù¨classifer‚ù≠ is a predictor whose codomain is a finite set. ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ In this case, we call the codomain the ‚ù¨label set‚ù≠ and we
    call its elements ‚ù¨classes‚ù≠ (or ‚ù¨labels‚ù≠, ‚ù¨categories‚ù≠). ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ We call the ‚Äπprediction‚Ä∫ of a classifier on an input a
    ‚ù¨classification‚ù≠. ‚¶â
‚¶â

¬∂ ‚¶ä
  ‚Äñ If the set of labels has two elements, then we call the
    classifier a ‚ù¨binary classifier‚ù≠ (or ‚ù¨two-way classifier‚ù≠,
    ‚ù¨two-class classifier‚ù≠, ‚ù¨boolean classifier‚ù≠). ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ In the case that there are $k$ labels, we call the
    classifier a ‚ù¨$k$-way classifier‚ù≠ (or ‚ù¨$k$-class classifier‚ù≠,
    ‚ù¨multi-class classifier‚ù≠). ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ The second term is meant to indicate, not that the
    classifier assigns to each point several classes, but that
    the classification decision is made ‚Äπbetween‚Ä∫ several classes. ‚¶â
‚¶â

¬ß¬ß Basic examples ‚¶â
¬∂ ‚¶ä
  ‚Äñ Let $A$ be a set of inputs and let $B$ be a set of
    labels. ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ Define $B = \set{0, 1}$ (or $\set{-1,1}$, {‚∏§False‚∏•, ‚∏§True‚∏•},
    {‚∏§Negative‚∏•, ‚∏§Positive‚∏•}). ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ Then $B$ is finite with two elements and $f: A ‚Üí B$ is a
    binary classifier with labels $0$ and $1$. ‚¶â
‚¶â

¬∂ ‚¶ä
  ‚Äñ If the case $B = $ $\{$‚∏§No‚∏•, ‚∏§Maybe‚∏•, ‚∏§Yes‚∏•$\}$, we call
    $f: A ‚Üí B$ a three-way classifier. ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ Other examples for $B$ include a list of languages, the set
    of English words in some dictionary, or the set of $m!$
    possible orders of $m$ horses in a race. ‚¶â
‚¶â

¬∂ ‚¶ä
  ‚Äñ When dealing with a finite set of $k$ arbitrary objects, it
    is often convenient to take associate the objects with the
    first $k$ positive integers and take the set $B = \set{1,
    ‚Ä¶, k}$ as the set of labels; here $k ‚àà ùó°$. ‚¶â
‚¶â

¬ß¬ß Other terminology ‚¶â
¬∂ ‚¶ä
  ‚Äñ Following our terminology, but speaking of processes, some
    authors refer to the application of inductors for these
    special cases as ‚ù¨binary classification‚ù≠ and ‚ù¨multi-class
    classification‚ù≠. ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ Or they speak of ‚ù¨classification‚ù≠ and ‚ù¨classification
    problems‚ù≠. ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ Roughly speaking, a classifier ‚ù¨classifies‚ù≠ all inputs into
    categories. ‚¶â
‚¶â

¬∂ ‚¶ä
  ‚Äñ Alternatively, some authors (especially in the statistics
    literature) refer to a classifier as a ‚ù¨discriminator‚ù≠ and
    reference ‚ù¨discrimination problems‚ù≠. ‚¶â
