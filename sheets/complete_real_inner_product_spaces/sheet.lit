§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝗥)$ be a real vector space. An inner product
    $\ip{·,·}: X× X → 𝗥$ induces a norm $\norm{·}: X → 𝗥$
    defined by $\norm{x} = √{\ip{x,x}}$ and metric $d: X × X →
    𝗥$ defined by $d(x, y) = \norm{x - y}$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ If $(X, d)$ is a complete metric space, we call $((X, 𝗥),
    \ip{·,·})$ a ❬complete real inner product space❭ (or ❬complete
    inner product space❭—without specifying that it is real— or a
    ❬Hilbert space❭).
    † ⦊
      ‖ The term Hilbert space is universal, but in accordance
        with the Bourbaki project’s guidelines on naming, we will
        tend to use the term complete inner product space, even
        though this is longer. ⦉
