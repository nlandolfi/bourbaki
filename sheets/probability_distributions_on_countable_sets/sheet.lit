§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose we flip a coin until it lands heads. ⦉

  ‖ What is the probability that we see a head after one flip? ⦉

  ‖ Two flips? ⦉

  ‖ $n$ flips? ⦉

  ‖ We want to extend our notion of probability distribution to
    a set with infinite elements, but only countably many. ⦉
⦉

§ Discussion ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Consider a set $A$.

      ‖ Future editions will rework this sheet. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ If $A$ has $n$ elements, then a probability distribution on
    $A$ is $p: A → 𝗥$ where $p(a) = 1/n$. ⦉

  ‖ There is a natural candidate. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ What if $A$ is the set of natural numbers $𝗡$. ⦉

  ‖ The principle difficulty is that not all sequences ⦉

  ‖ of real numbers $a: 𝗡 → 𝗥$ are summable. ⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬(countable) probability distribution❭ on $𝗡$ is $p: 𝗡 →
    𝗥$ where $p ≥ 0$ and

¶ ⦊
  ‖ More generally, a probability distribution on some countable
    set $C$ which we have numbered $c: 𝗡 → C$, is a function
    $p: C → [0,1]$ such that
