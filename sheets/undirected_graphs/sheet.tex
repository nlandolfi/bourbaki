\ssection{Why}
We want to visualize symmetric relations.

\ssection{Definition}

An \t{undirected graph} is a pair $(V, E)$ in which $V$ is a finite nonempty set and $E$ is a subset of unordered pairs of elements in $V$.
We call the elements of $V$ the \t{vertices} of the graph and the elements of $E$ the \t{edges}.
We call $(V, E)$ an undirected graph \t{on} $V$.

Two vertices are \t{adjacent} if their pair is in the edge set.
We say that the corresponding edge is \t{incident} to those vertices.
The \t{adjacency set} of a vertex is the set of vertices adjacent to it.
The \t{degree} of a vertex is the number of vertices adjacent to it; in other words, the size of its adjacency set.
A graph is \t{complete} if each pair of two distinct vertices is adjacent.

The \t{complement} of $(V, E)$ is the graph $(V, F)$ where $F$ is the complement of $E$ in the set of pairs from $V$.

\ssubsection{Other Terminology}

Some authors call the adjacency set the \t{neighborhood} of the vertex.
They call the union of the adjacency set of the vertex $v \in V$ with the singleton $\set{v}$ the \t{closed neighborhood} of $v$.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $V$ be a nonempty set.
Let $E \subset \Set*{\set{v, w}}{v, w \in V}$.
Then the pair $(V, E)$ is an undirected graph.
We regularly say \say{Let $G = (V, E)$} be a graph, in which the relevant properties of $V$ and $E$ are implicit.

The notation $\set{v, w} \in E$ for an edge between vertices $v, w \in V$ reminds us that the edges are unordered pairs of distinct vertices.
We denote the adjacency set of $v$ by $\adj(v)$ and the degree of $v$ by $\deg(v)$.

\ssection{Example}

For example, let $a, b, c, d, e$ be objects and consider an undirected graph $(V, E)$ defind by
$V = \set{a, b, c, d, e}$
and
  \[
E = \set*{\set{a, b}, \set{a, c}, \set{a, e}, \set{b, d}, \set{b, e}, \set{c, d}, \set{c, e}, \set{d,e}}.
  \]
In visualizations of undirected graphs, the vertices are frequently represented as circles or rectangles in the plane and edges are shown as lines connecting the vertices.

%If we have a relation between two sets, the
%standard corresponding graph is that obtained
%by considering the relation as defined on the
%union of the two sets. In this case we say the
%graph is \ct{bipartite}{bipartite‚Äù.
