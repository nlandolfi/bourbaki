§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬expectation❭ (or ❬expected value❭) of a real-valued
    random variable defined on a probability space is its
    integral with respect to the probability measure. ⦉

  ‖ The expectation of a random variable is also called its
    ❬mean❭. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $f: X → 𝗥$ is a random variable on a probability
    space $(X, 𝒜, P)$. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the expectation of $f$ by $𝗘f$, so that
