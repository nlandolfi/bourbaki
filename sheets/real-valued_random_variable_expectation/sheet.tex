\section*{Definition}

The \t{expectation} (or \t{expected value}) of a real-valued random variable defined on a probability space is its integral with respect to the probability measure.
The expectation of a random variable is also called its \t{mean}.

\subsection*{Notation}

Suppose $f: X \to \R $ is a random variable on a probability space $(X, \mathcal{A} , P)$.
We denote the expectation of $f$ by $\E f$, so that
\[
\E  f := \int  f dP.
\]
