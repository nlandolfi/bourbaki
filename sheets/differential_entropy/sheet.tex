\ssection{Why}

We want a notion of \say{uncertainty} for a real-valued (continuous) random variable.

\ssection{Definition}

The \t{relative entropy} of a probability density function is the integral of the density against the negative log of the density.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $f: \R^n \to \R$ be a probability density function.
The differential entropy of $f$ is
\[
  - \int f \log f
\]
We denote the differential entropy of $f$ by $h(f)$.
