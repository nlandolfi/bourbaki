§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We expect measure to have the common sense properties we
    stated when trying to define a notion of length for the
    real line. ⦉
⦉

§ Monotonicity ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ An extended-real-valued function on an alebra is ❬monotone❭
    if, given a first distinguished set contained in a
    distinguished second set, the result of the first is no
    greater than the result of the second. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ All measures are monotone. ⦉
</statement>
<proof>
  ‖ Let $(A, 𝒜, μ)$ be a measure space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $A, B ∈ 𝒜$ and $A ⊂ B$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $B = A ∪ (B - A)$, a disjoint union. ⦉

  ‖ So
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ μ(B) = μ(A ∪ (B - A))= μ(A) + μ(B - A), ⦉
    ⦉

    ‖ by the additivity of $μ$. ⦉

    ‖ Since $μ(B - A) ≥ 0$, ⦉

    ‖ we conclude $μ(A) ≤ μ(B)$. ⦉⦉
</proof>
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ If $A ⊂ B$ and $B$ finite, then $μ(B - A) = μ(B) -
    μ(A)$. ⦉
</statement>

§ Subadditivity ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Monotonicity along with additivity of measures give us one
    other convenient property: subadditivity. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ An extended-real-valued function on an algebra is
    ❬subadditive❭ if, given a sequence of distinguished sets, the
    result of union of the sequence is no greater than the
    limit of the partial sums of the results on each element of
    the sequence. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ All measures are subadditive. ⦉
</statement>
<proof>
  ‖ Let $(A, 𝒜, μ)$ be a measure space. ⦉
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Let $\set{A_n} ⊂ 𝒜$. ⦉

    ‖ Define $\set{B_n} ⊂ 𝒜$ with $B_n := A_n - ∪_{i =
      1}^{n-1} A_i$. ⦉

    ‖ Then $∪_n A_n = ∪_n B_n$, $\set{B_n}$ is a disjoint
      sequence, and $B_n ⊂ A_n$ for each $n$. ⦉

    ‖ So
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ μ(∪_{n} A_n) = μ(∪_{n} B_n) = ∑_{i = 1}^{∞} μ(B_n) ≤
          ∑_{i = 1}^{∞} μ(A_n), ⦉
      ⦉
      by additivity and then montonicity of measure. ⦉
  ⦉
</proof>
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The inequality involved in subadditivity is sometimes called
    ❬Boole's inequality❭ or ❬Bonferroni's inequalities❭ or the
    ❬union bound❭; each of these terms is most common when
    discussing␣

§ Limits ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Measures also behave well under limits. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ An extended-real-valued function on an algebra ❬resolves under
    increasing limits❭ if the result of the union of an
    increasing sequence of distinguished sets coincides with the
    limit of the sequence of results on the individual sets. ⦉

  ‖ An extended-real-valued function on an algebra ❬resolves under
    decreasing limits❭ if the result of the intersection of a
    decreasing sequence of distinguished sets coincides with the
    limit of the sequence of results on the individual sets. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ All measures resolve under increasing limits. ⦉
</statement>
<proof>
  ‖ Let $(A, 𝒜, μ)$ be a measure space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $\set{A_n}$ be an increasing sequence in $𝒜$. ⦉

  ‖ Then we want to show: ⦉

  ‖ $μ(\union_{n} A_n) = \lim_{n → ∞} μ(A_n)$. ⦉
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Define $\set{B_n}$ such that ⦉

    ‖ $B_n := A_n - \union_{i = 1}^{n-1} A_i$. ⦉

    ‖ Then $\set{B_n}$ is disjoint, $A_n = ∪_{i = 1}^{n} B_i$
      for each $n$, $∪_n A_n = ∪_n B_n$, and $μ(∪_{i = 1}^{n}
      B_i) = ∑_{i = 1}^{n} μ(B_i)$, by additivity. ⦉

    ‖ So
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ \begin{aligned} ⦉

        ‖ μ(∪_n A_n) ⦉

        ‖ ＆= μ(∪_n B_n) ᜶ ⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Measures resolve under decreasing ⦉

  ‖ limits if there is a finite set in ⦉

  ‖ the decreasing sequence. ⦉
</statement>
<proof>
  ‖ Let $(A, 𝒜, μ)$ be a measure space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $\set{A_n}$ be a decreasing sequence in $𝒜$ with one
    element finite. ⦉

  ‖ Then we want to show: ⦉

  ‖ $μ(∩_n A_n) = \lim_{n → ∞} μ(A_n)$. ⦉
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ On one hand, ⦉

    ‖ let $n_0$ be the index of the first ⦉

    ‖ finite element of the sequence. ⦉

    ‖ Then for all $n ≥ n_0$, ⦉

    ‖ the sequence is finite because ⦉

    ‖ of the monotonicity of measure. ⦉

    ‖ Denote this decreasing finite subsequence ⦉

    ‖ of sets by $\set{B_n}$. ⦉

    ‖ Then $∩_{n} A_n = ∩_n B_n$ ⦉

    ‖ and $\lim_n A_n = \lim_n B_n$. ⦉
  ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ On the other hand, ⦉

    ‖ the sequence $\set{B_1 - B_n}$ is an ⦉

    ‖ increasing sequence in $𝒜$. ⦉

    ‖ Also $∩_n B_n = B_1 - ∪_n (B_1 - B_n)$. ⦉

    ‖ So
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ \begin{aligned} ⦉

        ‖ μ(∩_n B_n) ⦉

        ‖ ＆= μ(B_1 - ∪_n (B_1 - B_n)) ᜶ ⦉

        ‖ ＆= μ(B_1) - μ(∪_n (B_1 - B_n)) ᜶ ⦉
