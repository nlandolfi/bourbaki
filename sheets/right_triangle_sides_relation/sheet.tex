\section*{Why}

How does constraining a triangle to be a right angle constrain the lengths of its sides?
\section*{Result}

\begin{proposition}
Let $a$ and $b$ be the lengths of the sides of a right triangle and $c$ be the length of the hypotenuse. Then
\[
a^2 + b^2 = c^2.
\]
\end{proposition}

The result is called \t{Pythagorean theorem} and the equation is called the \t{Pythagorean equation}.
