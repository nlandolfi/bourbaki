\ssection{Why}
Given a right triangle,

\ssection{Result}
\begin{proposition}
Let $a$ and $b$ be the lengths of the sides of a right triangle and $c$ be the length of the hypotenuse. Then
  \[
a^2 + b^2 = c^2.
  \]
\end{proposition}
The result is called \t{Pythagorean theorem} and the equation is called the \t{Pythagorean equation}.
