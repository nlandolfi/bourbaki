§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Consider a joint distribution with $n$ components. ⦉

  ‖ We associate with this joint $n$ ❬marginal distributions❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ For $i = 1, …, n$, the ❬$i$th marginal distribution❭ of
    the joint is the distribution over the $i$th set in the
    product which assigns to each element of that set the sum
    of probabilities of outcomes whose $i$th component matches
    that element. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ For $i,j = 1, …, n$ and $i ≠ j$, the ❬$i,j$th marginal
    distribution❭ of the joint is the distribution over the
    product of the $i$th and $j$th sets in the original product
    which assigns to each element in the product the sum of
    probabilities of outcomes whose $i$ component matches the
    first component of the product and whose $j$th component
    matches the $j$th component of the product. ⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A_1, …, A_n$ be non-empty finite sets. ⦉

  ‖ Define $A = ∏_{i = 1}^{n} A_i$ and let $p: A → 𝗥$ be a
    joint distribution. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ For $i = 1, …, n$, define $p_i: A_i → 𝗥$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ p_i(b) = ∑_{a | a_i = b} p(a). ⦉
    ⦉
    for each $b ∈ A_i$. ⦉

  ‖ $p_i$ is the $i$th marginal of $p$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Similarly, for $i, j = 1, …, n$ and $i ≠ j$ define
    $p_{ij}: A_i × A_j → 𝗥$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ p_{ij}(b, c) = ∑_{a | a_i = b, a_j = c} p(a) ⦉
    ⦉
    for every $b ∈ A_i$ and $c ∈ A_j$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $p_{ij}$ is the $i,j$th marginal of $p$. ⦉
