\ssection{Definition}

The marginal distribution is

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $R$ denote the set of
real numbers.
Let $A_1, \dots, A_n$ be
a sequence of non-empty finite
sets.
Let $A = \prod_{i = 1}^{n} A_i$
Let $p: A \to R$ be a distribution
on $A$.
We denote the $i$th marginal
distribution of $p$ by $p_i: A_i \to R$
For $i = 1, \dots, n$,
$p_i$ satisifes
\[
  p_i(b) = \sum_{a_i = b} p(a)
\]
for each $b \in A_i$.

Similarly we can define the
marginal over $i$ and $j$
for $i, j = 1, \dots, n$
and $i \neq j$ by
\[
  p_{ij}(b, c) = \sum_{a_i = b, a_j = c} p(a)
\]
for every $b \in A_i$ and $c \in A_j$.
