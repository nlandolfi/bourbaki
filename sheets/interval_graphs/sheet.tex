\section*{Why}

They arise in scheduling problems.
They are chordal.

\section*{Definition}

The \t{intersection graph} of a finite family of sets is the undirected graph on the family containing an edge between any two vertices whose intersection is non-empty.
An \t{interval graph} is the intersection graph of a family of intervals on the real line.

\section*{Chordality}

\begin{proposition}
All interval graphs are chordal.
