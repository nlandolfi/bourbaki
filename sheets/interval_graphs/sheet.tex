\ssection{Why}

They arise in scheduling problems.
They are chordal.

\ssection{Definition}

The \t{intersection graph} of a finite family of sets is the undirected graph on the family containing an edge between any two vertices whose intersection is non-empty.
An \t{interval graph} is the intersection graph of a family of intervals on the real line.

\ssubsection{Notation}

\ssection{Chordality}

\begin{prop}

  All interval graphs are chordal.
