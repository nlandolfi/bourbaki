§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose a cashier needs to provide $c ∈ 𝗭_+$ cents in
    change, and wants to do so using the using the fewest (or
    most) number of coins, each worth a different number of
    cents. ⦉

  ‖ We can model this as a problem similar to the bounded
    knapsack problem, in which we have an equality constraint
    instead of an inequality one. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given $w: \set{1, …, n} → 𝗥_+$, $b ∈ 𝗭_+^n$, find $x ∈
    𝗭_+^n$ to
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \begin{aligned} ⦉

      ‖ \text{minimize} & \quad ∑_i x_i ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ \text{subject to} & \quad ∑_{j = 1}^n w_j x_j = c ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ & \quad 0 ≤ x ≤ b, x ∈ 𝗭_{n}^{+} ⦉

  ‖ This problem is often called a ❬change-making problem❭. ⦉

  ‖ Without the budget constraints, it is called an ❬unbounded
    change-making problem❭. ⦉
