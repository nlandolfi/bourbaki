\section*{Definition}

An \t{autonomous continuous-time linear dynamical system} is a matrix $A \in \R ^{n \times  n}$.
It models the behavior of a \t{signal} $x: \R  \to \R ^n$ by
\begin{equation}
    \label{defining}\dot{x} = Ax,\end{equation}
where $\dot{x}$ is notation for $\frac{d}{dt} x(t)$.
$A$ is called the \t{dynamics matrix}.

A signal $x$ satisfying Equation~\eqref{defining} is called a \t{solution} or a \t{trajectory}.
For $t \in \R $, $x(t) \in \R ^n$ is called the \t{state} and $\R ^n$ is called the state space.
$n$ is called the \t{state dimension}.
