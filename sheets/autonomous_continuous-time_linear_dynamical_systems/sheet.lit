§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ An ❬autonomous continuous-time linear dynamical system❭ is a
    matrix $A ∈ 𝗥^{n × n}$. ⦉

  ‖ It models the behavior of a ❬signal❭ $x: 𝗥 → 𝗥^n$ by
    <equation id='defining'>
      ‖ \dot{x} = Ax, ⦉
    </equation>
    where $\dot{x}$ is notation for $\frac{d}{dt} x(t)$. ⦉

  ‖ $A$ is called the ❬dynamics matrix❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A signal $x$ satisfying Equation~\eqref{defining} is called
    a ❬solution❭ or a ❬trajectory❭. ⦉

  ‖ For $t ∈ 𝗥$, $x(t) ∈ 𝗥^n$ is called the ❬state❭ and $𝗥^n$
    is called the state space. ⦉

  ‖ $n$ is called the ❬state dimension❭. ⦉
