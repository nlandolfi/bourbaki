\section*{Why}

We want to associate the elements of some finite set with bit strings.

\section*{Definition}

Let $X$ be a set with $\nu m{X} = n$.
Let $x: \upto{n} \to X$ be an ordering of $X$.
The \t{digital symbol} associated with $x_i \in X$ is the digital integer associated with the natural number $i$.

In this context $X$ is called sometimes called an \t{alphabet} or \t{symbol set}.
