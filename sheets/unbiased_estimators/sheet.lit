§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Consider a random variable $x: Ω → 𝗥^n$. ⦉

  ‖ The error of the estimate $ξ ∈ 𝗥^n$ is the random variable
    $e: Ω → 𝗥^n$ which is defined by $e(ω) = x(ω) - ξ$. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬bias❭ of an estimate is the expected value of the
    error. ⦉

  ‖ An estimate is ❬unbiased❭ if it has zero bias. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Likewise, if we have another random variable $y: Ω → 𝗥^m$,
    then the error of the estimator $f: 𝗥^m → 𝗥^n$ is the
    random variable $e: Ω → 𝗥^n$ defined by $e(ω) = f(x(ω)) -
    y(ω)$. ⦉
