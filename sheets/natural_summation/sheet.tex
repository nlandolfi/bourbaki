\ssection{Why}

We want a notation for expressing
the sum of several natural numbers.

\ssection{Definition}

Let $s = (m_1, \dots, m_n)$ be a sequence
of natural numbers. The \ct{sequence sum}{}
of $s$ is the result of first summing the
first two numbers, then summing the result
with the third number, and so on, until we
have summed all the numbers

\subsection{Notation}

We denote the sum of a sequence using
by using the $\sum$ symbol.
$\sum$ is the capital greek letter
\say{sigma} and
is a mnemonic for \say{sum.}

Let $(m_1, \dots, m_n)$ be a sequence
of natural numbers.
Let us denote by $m_i$ an element of
the sequence, where $i = 1, \dots, n$.

We denote that the sum ranges
over an (ordered) index set $\set{1, \dots, n}$
by writing $\sum_{i = 1}^{n}$.
We denote the sequence sum
\[
  \sum_{i = 1}^{n} m_i.
\]
