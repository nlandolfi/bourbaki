\section*{Why}

We want a notation for expressing the sum of several natural numbers.

\section*{Definition}

Let $s = (m_1, \dots , m_n)$ be a sequence of natural numbers. The \t{sequence sum} of $s$ is the result of first summing the first two numbers, then summing the result with the third number, and so on, until we have summed all the numbers

\subsection*{Notation}

We denote the sum of a sequence using by using the $\sum$ symbol. $\sum$ is the capital greek letter \say{sigma} and is a mnemonic for \say{sum.}

Let $(m_1, \dots , m_n)$ be a sequence of natural numbers.
Let us denote by $m_i$ an element of the sequence, where $i = 1, \dots , n$.

We denote that the sum ranges over an (ordered) index set $\set{1, \dots , n}$ by writing $\sum_{i = 1}^{n}$.
We denote the sequence sum
    \[
\sum_{i = 1}^{n} m_i.
    \]
