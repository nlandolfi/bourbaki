\section*{Why}

We want a notation for expressing the sum of several natural numbers.

\section*{Definition}

Let $s = (m_1, \dots , m_n)$ be a sequence of natural numbers. The \t{sequence sum} of $s$ is the result of first summing the first two numbers, then summing the result with the third number, and so on, until we have summed all the numbers

\subsection*{Notation}

We denote the sum of a sequence using by using the $\sum$ symbol. $\sum$ is the capital greek letter ``sigma'' and is a mnemonic for ``sum.''

Let $(m_1, \dots , m_n)$ be a sequence of natural numbers.
Let us denote by $m_i$ an element of the sequence, where $i = 1, \dots , n$.

We denote that the sum ranges over an (ordered) index set $\set{1, \dots , n}$ by writing $\sum_{i = 1}^{n}$.
We denote the sequence sum
    \[
\sum_{i = 1}^{n} m_i.
    \]

\subsection*{Summing over finite sets}

Suppose $A$ is a finite set and $f: A \to \N  $ is a function.
Then we the notation
    \[
\sum_{a \in A} f(a)
    \]
is notation for $\sum_{i = 1}^{n} f(\sigma (i))$ where $\sigma : \set{1, \dots , \num{A}} \to A$ is any numbering of $A$.
The numbering is inconsequential because addition is commutative.
