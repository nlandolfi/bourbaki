§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want a notation for expressing the sum of several
    natural numbers. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $s = (m_1, …, m_n)$ be a sequence of natural numbers.
    The ❬sequence sum❭ of $s$ is the result of first summing
    the first two numbers, then summing the result with the
    third number, and so on, until we have summed all the
    numbers ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the sum of a sequence using by using the $∑$
    symbol. $∑$ is the capital greek letter “sigma” and is a
    mnemonic for “sum.” ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(m_1, …, m_n)$ be a sequence of natural numbers. ⦉

  ‖ Let us denote by $m_i$ an element of the sequence, where
    $i = 1, …, n$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote that the sum ranges over an (ordered) index set
    $\set{1, …, n}$ by writing $∑_{i = 1}^{n}$. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the sequence sum
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ ∑_{i = 1}^{n} m_i. ⦉

§§ Summing over finite sets ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $A$ is a finite set and $f: A → 𝗡$ is a function. ⦉

  ‖ Then we the notation
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ ∑_{a ∈ A} f(a) ⦉
    ⦉
    is notation for $∑_{i = 1}^{n} f(σ(i))$ where $σ: \set{1,
    …, \num{A}} → A$ is any numbering of $A$. ⦉

  ‖ The numbering is inconsequential because addition is
    commutative. ⦉
