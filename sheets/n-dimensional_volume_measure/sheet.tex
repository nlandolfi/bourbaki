\section*{Definition}

We denote the \t{volume measure} (or \t{n-dimensional space measure}, \t{space measure}, \t{Lebesgue measure}) on $\R ^n$ by $\lambda $.\footnote{Future editions will clean up and complete the development.}

\subsection*{Notation}

We denote the volume of a measurable set $A \subset \R ^d$ by $\vol(A)$, or sometimes $\vol_d(A)$ to indicate the dimension.
