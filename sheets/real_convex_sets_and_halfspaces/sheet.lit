§ Main result ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(b_i)_{i ∈ I}$ be a family in $𝗥^n$ and $(β_i)_{i ∈
    I}$ be a family in $𝗥$. The set

      ‖ \Set*{x ∈ 𝗥^n}{\ip{x,b_i} ≤ β_i \text{ for all } i ∈ I} ⦉
    ⦉
    is convex. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬polyhedral❭ convex set is one which can be expressed as
    the intersection of a finite family of closed halfspaces. ⦉
