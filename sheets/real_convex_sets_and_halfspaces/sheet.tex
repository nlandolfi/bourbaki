Let $(b_i)_{i \in I}$ be a family in $\R ^n$ and $(\beta _i)_{i \in I}$ be a family in $\R $. The set
\[
\Set*{x \in \R ^n}{\ip{x,b_i} \leq \beta _i \text{ for all } i \in I}
\]
is convex.

A \t{polyhedral} convex set is one which can be expressed as the intersection of a finite family of closed halfspaces.
