§ Problem ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Consider the sequence $(a_n)_{n ∈ 𝗡}$ defined by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ a_n = \frac{1}{n^2}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Does $\lim_{N → ∞} ∑_{n = 1}^{N} a_n$ exist? ⦉

  ‖ If so, what is the limit? ⦉

  ‖ These questions are known as the ❬Basel problem❭. ⦉
⦉

§ Solution ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>

    ‖ \lim_{N → ∞} ∑_{n = 1}^{N} s_n = \frac{π^2}{6}. ⦉
