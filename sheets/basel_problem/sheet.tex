\section*{Problem}

Consider the sequence $(a_n)_{n \in \N  }$ defined by
\[
a_n = \frac{1}{n^2}.
\]
Does $\lim_{N \to \infty} \sum_{n = 1}^{N} a_n$ exist?
If so, what is the limit?
These questions are known as the \t{Basel problem}.

\section*{Solution}

\begin{proposition}
\[
\lim_{N \to \infty} \sum_{n = 1}^{N} s_n = \frac{\pi ^2}{6}.
\]
\end{proposition}
