\ssection{Why}

If we have a norm, then we
have a metric.

\ssection{Motivating Result}

Let $R$ be the set of real
numbers.

\begin{prop}
Let $(V, F)$ be a vector space.
Let $f: V \to R$ be a norm.
Let $g: V \times V \to R$ such
that
\[
  g(x, y) = \norm{x - y}.
\]
  Then $g$ is a metric.\footnote{Future editions will include an account.}
\end{prop}
