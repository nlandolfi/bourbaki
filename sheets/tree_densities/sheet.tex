\ssection{Why}

As with distributions, if a density factors according to a tree rooted at a particular vertex, it factors according to a tree rooted at any vertex.
So, as before, the property of factoring according to a rooted tree is really a property of factoring according to a tree.

\ssection{Definition}

\ssubsection{Defining Result}

\begin{prop}

If a density factors according to a tree rooted at a vertex it factors according to that tree rooted at any vertex.

\begin{proof}

TODO

\end{proof}

\end{prop}

\ssubsection{Undirected Definition}

A density \t{factors according to a tree} if it factors according to the tree rooted at any vertex.

\ssection{Existence and Uniqueness}

Trees are not a property of densities,
since there is no one-to-one correspondence,
as demonstrated by the following propositions.

\ssubsection{Existence}

\begin{prop}
  A density $f$ need not factor according to a tree.
\end{prop}

\ssubsection{Uniqueness}

\begin{prop}
  A density $f$ may factor according to multiple trees.
\end{prop}
