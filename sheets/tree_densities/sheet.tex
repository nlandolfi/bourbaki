\section*{Why}

As with distributions, if a density factors according to a tree rooted at a particular vertex, it factors according to a tree rooted at any vertex.
So, as before, the property of factoring according to a rooted tree is really a property of factoring according to a tree.

\section*{Defining result}

\begin{proposition}
If a density factors according to a tree rooted at a vertex it factors according to that tree rooted at any vertex.

\end{proposition}

\section*{Undirected definition}

A density \t{factors according to a tree} if it factors according to the tree rooted at any vertex.

\section*{Existences and uniqueness}

Trees are not a property of densities, since there is no one-to-one correspondence, as demonstrated by the following propositions.

\subsection*{Existence}

\begin{proposition}
A density $f$ need not factor according to a tree.
\end{proposition}

\subsection*{Uniqueness}

\begin{proposition}
A density $f$ may factor according to multiple trees.
\end{proposition}
