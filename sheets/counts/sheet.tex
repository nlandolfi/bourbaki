\s{Definition}

We want to know how many of an indistinguishable object we have.
Let $a$ be that object.
If I have one of $a$, say I have the set $\set{a}$.
The weirdness is that two of $a$ is not the pair $\set{a,a}$, because that pair is the same $\say{a}$ and so the same as two.
We can take notes from ordered pairs, though, and say that when I have two of $a$ I have $(a,a)$.
What then of the gneeralization to tripels?
I have $(a, a, a) = ((a, a), a)$
Which is $\set{\set{(a, a)}, \set{(a, a), a}}$
Which is $\set{\set{\set{\set{a}, \set{a}}}, \set{\set{\set{a}, \set{a}}, a}}$.

\[
  \begin{aligned}
  1 = \set{a} \\
  2  = (a, a) = \set{\set{a}, \set{a}} \\
  3  = ((a, a), a) = (2, a)
  \end{aligned}
\]
