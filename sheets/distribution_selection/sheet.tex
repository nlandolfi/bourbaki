\ssection{Why}

We have a dataset and want to select
a probability distribution to summarize it.

\ssection{Overview}

We have a set of outcomes $A$.
We have a dataset $(a^1, \dots, a^n)$
in $A$.
We want to define a correspondence between
the dataset and probability distributions
over the set of outcomes $A$.
