\ssection{Why}

We have a dataset in some set and want to
summarize it by a probability distribution.

\ssection{Overview}

We have a set of outcomes $A$.
We have a dataset $(a^1, \dots, a^n)$
in $A$.
We want to define a correspondence between
the dataset and probability distributions
over the set of outcomes $A$.

We will call proposals for such a correspondence
\ct{principles of distribution selection}{}.

Notice that we do not want a distribution on
the record sequences. In other words, we want
a distribution on $A$ not a distribution on
$A^n$.
