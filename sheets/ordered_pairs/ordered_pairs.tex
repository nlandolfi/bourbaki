\stitle{Ordered Pairs}

\ssection{Why}

We speak of
an ordered pair of
objects:
one selected
from a first set
and one selected from
a second set.

\ssection{Definition}

Let $A$ and $B$ be
non-empty
\rt{sets}{set}.
Let $a \in A$ and
$b \in B$.
The
\ct{ordered pair}{pair}
of $a$ and $b$
is the set
$\set{\set{a}, \set{a, b}}$.
The \ct{first element}{firstelement}
of $\set{\set{a}, \set{a, b}}$
is $a$ and
the \ct{second element}{secondelement}
is $b$.

The
\ct{cartesian product}{cartesianproduct}
of $A$ and $B$ is the set
of all ordered pairs.
If $A \neq B$,
the ordering causes
the cartesian product of
$A$ and $B$
to differ from
the cartesian product of
$B$ with $A$.
If $A = B$, however, the
symmetry holds.

\ssubsection{Notation}
We denote the ordered pair
$\set{\set{a},\set{a,b}}$
by $(a, b)$.
We denote the cartesian product
of $A$ with $B$ by
$A \cross B$, read aloud as
\say{A cross B.}
In this notation,
if $A \neq B$, then
$A \cross B \neq B \cross A$.
