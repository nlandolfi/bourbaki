§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given an outcome variable $X: Ω → V$, and some
    probabilities on a sample space $Ω$, there is a natural set
    of probabilities to associate with outcomes in $V$. ⦉
⦉

§ Result ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $X: Ω → V$ is a random variable on a finite
    sample space $Ω$. ⦉

  ‖ Given $p: Ω → 𝗥$ is a probability distribution inducing
    probability measure $P: \pow{Ω} → 𝗥$, define the function $q:
    V → 𝗥$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ q(x) = P(X = x) ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ It is easy to verify that $q$ is nonnegative and normalized. ⦉

  ‖ The latter fact follows from the observation that the sets
    $\set{X^{-1}(x)}{x ∈ V}$ partition the set $Ω$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The function $q$ is sometimes called the ❬induced
    distribution❭ (or ❬induced probability distribution❭) of the
    random variable $X$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given a random variable $X: Ω → V$, and some distribution
    $p: Ω → 𝗥$, it is common to denote the induced distribution
    by $p_X$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Computation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $X: Ω → V$ is a random variable and $f: V → U$. ⦉

  ‖ Define $Y: Ω → V$ by $y(ω) \equiv f(x(ω))$ for every $ω ∈
    Ω$. ⦉

  ‖ We frequently denote this by $Y = f(X)$. ⦉

  ‖ $Y$ is a random variable with induced distribution $p_{Y}: Ω
    → 𝗥$ satisfying
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \textstyle ⦉

      ‖ p_{Y}(y) = ∑_{ω ∈ Ω ｜Y(ω) = y} p(ω) = ∑_{x ∈ V |
        f(x) = b} p_X(x). ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Consequently, as a matter of practical computation, we can
    evaluate probabilities having to do with the outcome variable
    $X$ using $p_X$ instead of $p$ and same with $Y$.
