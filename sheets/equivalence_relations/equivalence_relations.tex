\stitle{Equivalence Relations}

\ssection{Why}

We want to handle at once
all the objects of a set
which are indistinguishable
or equivalent in some aspect.
We want to generalize the
key properties of identity.

\ssection{Definition}

An \ct{equivalence relation}{equivalencerelation}
is a
\rt{reflexive}{reflexive},
\rt{symmetric}{symmetric},
and
\rt{transitive}{transitive} relation.

\ssubsection{Notation}

If $R$ is an equivalence relation on a set $A$,
we use the symbol $\sim$.
When alone, $\sim$ is read aloud as \say{sim,} but we still
read $a \sim b$ aloud as \say{a equivalent to b.}
