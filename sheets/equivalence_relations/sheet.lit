§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to handle at once all the objects of a set which
    are indistinguishable or equivalent in some aspect. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ An ❬equivalence relation❭ on a set $X$ is a reflexive,
    symmetric, and transitive relation on $X$ (see␣
    <a href='/sheets/relations.html'>
      ‖ Relations ⦉
    </a>
    ). ⦉

  ‖ The smallest equivalence relation in a set $X$ is the
    relation of equality in $X$. ⦉

  ‖ The largest equivalence relation in a set $X$ is $X ×X$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Equivalence relations are useful because they partition (see␣
    <a href='/sheets/partitions.html'>
      ‖ Partitions ⦉
    </a>
    ) the set. ⦉

  ‖ If $R$ is an equivalence relation on $X$, the ❬equivalence
    class❭ of an object $x ∈ X$ is the set $\Set{y ∈
    X}{x\;R\;y}$. ⦉

  ‖ We call the set of equivalence classes the ❬quotient set❭
    of the set under the relation (or the ❬quotient❭ of the set
    ❬by the relation❭). ⦉

  ‖ An equally good name is the divided set of the set under
    the relation, but this terminology is not standard. ⦉

  ‖ The language in both cases reminds us that the relation
    partitions the set into equivalence classes. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ If $𝒞$ is a partition of $X$, we can define a relation
    $R$ on $X$ for which $x\,R\,y \iff (∃A ∈ 𝒞)(x ∈ A ∧ y ∈
    A)$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, if $x$ and $y$ are in the same piece (see␣
    <a href='/sheets/partitions.html'>
      ‖ Partitions ⦉
    </a>
    ) of $𝒞$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The key result is that every equivalence relation partitions
    the set and every partition of the set is an equivalence
    relation. ⦉

  ‖ Moreover, if we start with an equivalence relation, look for
    the partition, and then get the relation defined by the
    partition, we end up with the relation we started with. ⦉

  ‖ Likewise, if we start with a partition relation, get the
    equivalence relation, and then get the partition defined by
    the relation, we end up with the partition we started with. ⦉

  ‖ Before stating and proving this result, we give some
    notation. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $R$ denote an equivalence relation on a set denoted by
    $X$. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the equivalence class of $x ∈ X$ by $x / R$. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the set of equivalence classes of $R$ by $X/R$,
    read aloud as “$X$ modulo $R$” or “$x$ mod $R$”. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the equivalence class of an element $x ∈ X$ by
    $\eqc{x}$. ⦉
⦉

§ Main Results ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The proofs of these results are straightforward.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Nonetheless, the full accounts will appear in future
        editions. ⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ These last two propositions make clear the rationale for the
    notation. ⦉

  ‖ The function mapping an element to its equivalence class is
    onto and is sometimes called the ❬projection❭. ⦉
