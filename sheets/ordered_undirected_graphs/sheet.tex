\ssection{Why}

TODO
Need for perfect elimination orderings.

\ssection{definition}

An \t{ordering} of an undirected graph is a numbering of its vertices.
An \t{ordered undirected graph} is a triple: the first two objects as an ordered pair are an undirected graph and the third object is a numbering of this graphs vertices.

\ssection{Notation}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph with $n = \num{V}$.
Let $\sigma: \set{1, 2, \dots, n} \to V$ be a numbering of $V$.
We denote the ordered graph consisting of $G$ and $\sigma$ as $G_{\sigma} = (V, E, \sigma)$.
