\section*{Definition}

Suppose $A \subset \R $.
A point $x \in \R $ is a \t{limit point} of $A$ if there exists a sequence $a: \N   \to A$ so that $a_n \to x$
In other words, the limit points of $A$ are the points which are the limits of some sequences in $A$.

It is possible that $x \not\in A$ but $x$ is a limit point.
The \t{closure} of $A$ is the set containing $A$ and all limit points of $A$.

\subsection*{Notation}

The closure of $A \subset \R $ is denoted $\bar{A}$.
Other notation includes $\cl(A)$.
