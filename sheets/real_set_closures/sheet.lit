§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $A ⊂ 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ A point $x ∈ 𝗥$ is a ❬limit point❭ of $A$ if there
    exists a sequence $a: 𝗡 → A$ so that $a_n → x$ ⦉

  ‖ In other words, the limit points of $A$ are the points
    which are the limits of some sequences in $A$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ It is possible that $x ∉ A$ but $x$ is a limit point. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬closure❭ of $A$ is the set containing $A$ and all
    limit points of $A$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The closure of $A ⊂ 𝗥$ is denoted $\bar{A}$. ⦉

  ‖ Other notation includes $\cl(A)$. ⦉
