§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬span❭ of a finite set of vectors $v_1, …, v_k ∈ 𝗥^n$
    is the set of all linear combiniations of the vectors $v_1,
    …, v_k$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ More generally, given a set $A ⊂ 𝗥^n$ the span of $A$ is
    the set of all linear combinations formed from finite subsets
    of $A$. ⦉

  ‖ This is sometimes also called the ❬linear hull❭ of $A$. ⦉
⦉

‖ The span of a set of vectors is a subspace. ⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the span of $v_1, …, x_k ∈ 𝗥^d$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \span(\set{v_1, …, v_k}) ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Other notation in use, in particular when we are dealing
    with the span of a set $A ⊂ 𝗥^d$ is $\lin A$. ⦉
