\section*{Definition}

The \t{span} of a finite set of vectors $v_1, \dots , v_k \in \R ^n$ is the set of all linear combiniations of the vectors $v_1, \dots , v_k$.

More generally, given a set $A \subset \R ^n$ the span of $A$ is the set of all linear combinations formed from finite subsets of $A$.
This is sometimes also called the \t{linear hull} of $A$.

The span of a set of vectors is a subspace.
\subsection*{Notation}

We denote the span of $v_1, \dots , x_k \in \R ^d$ by
\[
\span(\set{v_1, \dots , v_k})
\]
Other notation in use, in particular when we are dealing with the span of a set $A \subset \R ^d$ is $\lin A$.
