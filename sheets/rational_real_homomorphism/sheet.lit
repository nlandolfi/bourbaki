§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Do the rational numbers correspond (in the sense of␣
    <a href='/sheets/homomorphisms.html'>
      ‖ Homomorphisms ⦉
    </a>
    ) to elements of the reals. ⦉
⦉

§ Main result ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Indeed, roughly speaking the rationals correspond to elements
    of the reals which are bounded above by that rational. ⦉

  ‖ Denote by $\tilde{𝗥}$ the set $\Set{q ∈ 𝗥}{∃s ∈ 𝗤, q =
    \Set{t ∈ 𝗤}{t < s}}$. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ The fields $(\tilde{𝗥}, +_{𝗥} |\tilde{𝗥}, ·_{𝗥} |\tilde{𝗥})$
    and $(Q, +_{𝗤}, ·_{Q})$ are homomorphic.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Indeed, more is true and will be included in future
        editions. There is an ‹order perserving› field homomorphism. ⦉

</statement>
<proof>
  ‖ The function is $f: 𝗤 → 𝗥$ with $f(q) = \Set{(r ∈ 𝗤}{r <
    q}$ ⦉
