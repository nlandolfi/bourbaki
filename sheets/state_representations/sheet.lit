§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $𝒫 = ((𝒜^i)_{i = 1}^{n}, (𝒪^i)_{i = 1}^{n}, ≼)$ be an
    $n$-stage decision problem with constant actions sets $𝒜^t_{h}
    = U_t$ for each history $h ∈ H^{t-1}$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, the actions available at stage $t$ do not
    depend on the history, only on the stage $t$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬state representation❭ for $𝒫$ is tuple
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ (\set{𝒳_t}_{t = 1}^{n+1}, \set{f_{t}: 𝒳_t × 𝒰_t →
        𝒳_{t+1}}_{t = 1}^{n}) ⦉
    ⦉

    ‖ satisfying $x_{t+1} = f_t(u_t, x_t)$ for all $x_t ∈ 𝒳_t$,
      $x_{t+1} ∈ 𝒳_{t+1}$, $u_t ∈ 𝒰_t$, $t = 1, …, n$.
      † ⦊
        ‖ Future editions will continue this development, and add
          the other necessary conditions on state representations.
          To say more here is involved, and this sheet will
          likely me reworked to use the genetic method via
          applications in celestial mechanics. ⦉
