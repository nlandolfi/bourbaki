§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to discuss making several decisions over time. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A^{1}$ be a set of actions and $\mathcal{O}^1 =
    \set{O^{1}_a}$ a family of outcome sets. ⦉

  ‖ Define $H^1 = \Set*{(a, o)}{a ∈ A^1, o ∈ O^{1}_a}$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $𝒜^2 = \set{A^{2}_{h^1}}_{h^1 ∈ H^1}$ be a family of
    action sets. ⦉

  ‖ Define
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \tilde{H}^{2} = \Set*{(a_1, o_1, a_2)}{(a_1, o_1) ∈ H^1,
        a_2 ∈ A^{2}_{a_1o_1}}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Let $\mathcal{C}^2 = \set{O^{2}_{h}}_{h ∈ \tilde{H}^2}$ be a
    family of outcome sets. ⦉

  ‖ Define
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ H^2 = \Set{(a_1, o_1, a_2, o_2)}{h = (a_1, o_1, a_2) ∈
        \tilde{H}^2, o_2 ∈ O_{h}}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Let $≼$ be a total order on $H^2$. ⦉

  ‖ Then we call the sequence $((A^1, 𝒜^2), (\mathcal{O}^1,
    \mathcal{O}^2), ≼)$ a ❬two-stage decision problem❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ In general, let $𝒜^{i} = \set{A^i_{h}}_{h ∈ H^{i-1}}$ be a
    family of action sets, define $\tilde{H}^i$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \Set*{(a_1, …, o_{i-1}, a_i)}{h = (a_1, …, o_{i-1}) ∈
        H^{i-1}, a_i ∈ A^i_{h}}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Let $\mathcal{O}^{i+1} = \set{O^{i+1}_{h}}_{h ∈ \tilde{H}^{i}}$
    be a family of outcome sets. Define $H^{i}$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \Set*{(a_1, …, a_i, o_i)}{h = (a_1, …, a_i) ∈
        \tilde{H}^{i}, o_i ∈ O^i_{h}}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ For $i = 3, …, n$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $≼$ be a total order on $H^{n}$. ⦉

  ‖ We call $H^i$ the ❬histories until time $i$❭. ⦉

  ‖ In this case we identify $𝒜^1 = A^1$ and call $((𝒜^i)_{i =
    1}^{n}, (\mathcal{O}^i)_{i = 1}^{n}, ≼)$ an ❬$n$-stage decision
    problem❭ (or ❬multi-stage decision problem❭ or ❬sequential
    decision problem❭).
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will clarify these definitions. ⦉

§§ Simplifications ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Discussing $n$-stage decision problems is complicated, as the
    notation indicates. ⦉

  ‖ How can we simplify thinking about them? ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ One simplification occurs when the outcome sets at stage $i$
    do not depend on the action taken, or on the history of
    actions. ⦉

  ‖ In this case, we may discuss outcome sets $O^i$ for $i =
    1, …, n$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Another simplification occurs when the decisions to be made
    at each stage do not depend on the action taken or on the
    history of actions. ⦉

  ‖ In this case, we may discuss action sets $A^i$ for $i =
    1, …, n$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ An even greater simplification occurs when the outcome and
    actions sets do not depend on the stage $i$. ⦉

  ‖ In this case, we speak of ‹the› action set and ‹the›
    outcome set. ⦉
⦉

§ State
  † ⦊
    ‖ Future editions will move this to
      <a href='/sheets/state_representations.html'>
        ‖ State Representations ⦉
      </a>
      . ⦉
  ⦉⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Often we can summarize the history $H^i$ with a set $𝒳_i$. ⦉

  ‖ In this case, we speak of the set of states $S_i$ for $i
    = 1, …, n$. ⦉

  ‖ In this case, we can associate the history $H^1$ with an
    element of $S^1$. ⦉

  ‖ We can associate the history $H^2$ with an element of $S^2$. ⦉

  ‖ And so on. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Naturally, the current action affects the future states, but
    not the current or past states, since the state is a
    “summary” of the history, of the “past”.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Other language includes “sufficient statistic , but we
        will avoid this for now. Future sheets may modify.” ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ In this way, the state is a “link” between the “past” and
    the “future.” ⦉

  ‖ The idea is that the current action affects the future
    state, but not current or past states. ⦉

%We call the sequence $(A, O, \set{A'_{a,o}}, \set{O'_{a,o}}, \set{\preceq_{a,o}})$ a \t{two-stage decision problem}.
%The intuition is that we will select an action $a \in A$ prior to observing an outcome $o \in O$.
%We will then face the simple decision problem $(A'_{s,a}, O'_{s,a}, \preceq_{s,a})$.
%
%A \t{preference} for the two stage decision problem is a total order on the set

%	X = \Set*{(a, o, a', o')}{a \in A, o \in O, a' \in A_{a, o}', o' \in O_{a, o}'}.
