§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A conditional distribution (density) $q: Y ×X → 𝗥$ is
    ❬functionally parametrizable❭ if there exists a function $f: X
    → \Theta$ and distribution (density) family $\set{p^{(θ)}: Y →
    𝗥}_{θ ∈ \Theta}$ satisfying $q(y, x) ≡ p^{(f(x))}(γ)$ for all
    $x ∈ X$ and $y ∈ Y$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ In this case we call $f$ the ❬parameterizer❭ and we call
    $\set{p^{(θ)}}_{θ ∈ \Theta}$ the ❬parameterized family❭. ⦉

  ‖ A ❬parameterized conditional distribution❭ is an ordered pair
    whose first coordinate is a function from $X$ to $\Theta$
    and whose second coordinate is a family of distributions on
    $X$ with parameter set $\Theta$. ⦉

  ‖ For a particular choice of parameterizer and family, it
    induces a conditional distribution. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Since all conditional distributions are functionally
    parametrizable (consider $\set{q(·, ξ)}_{ξ ∈ X}$ with
    parameters $X$ and identity parameterizer), we are interested
    in parameterizers and parameterized families that are simple. ⦉

  ‖ Said differently, we are interested in approximating a
    conditional distribution by selecting an appropriate
    parameterizer and parameterized family. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ If $\set{f_{φ}: X → \Theta}_{φ ∈ \Phi}$ is a family of
    functions and $\set{q^{(θ)}}$ is a family of distributions,
    then $\set{p^{(φ)}: X ×Z → 𝗥}_{φ}$ defined by $p^{(φ)}(·, ζ)
    ≡ q^{f_φ(ζ)}$ is a conditional distribution family called a
    ❬functionally parameterized conditional distribution family❭. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, by selecting some parameters $φ$, we induce
    a conditional distribution $p^{(φ)}: X ×Z → 𝗥$ ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We similarly define ❬parameterized conditional densities❭ and
    ❬functionally parameterized conditional density families❭. ⦉
⦉

§§ Basic example ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $Z = \set{1, 2}$ and $X = 𝗥$. Let $f: \set{1, 2} →
    𝗥 ×𝗥_+$ be defined by $f(1) = (μ_1, σ_1)$ and $f(2) =
    (μ_2, σ_2)$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $\set{g^{(θ)}}_{θ}$ be the normal family. ⦉

  ‖ Then $(f, \set{g^{(θ)}})$ is a ❬functionally parameterized
    conditional density❭.
