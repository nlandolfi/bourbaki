\section*{Definition}

A conditional distribution (density) $q: Y \times X \to \R $ is \t{functionally parametrizable} if there exists a function $f: X \to \Theta$ and distribution (density) family $\set{p^{(\theta )}: Y \to \R }_{\theta  \in \Theta}$ satisfying $q(y, x) \equiv p^{(f(x))}(\gamma )$ for all $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$.

In this case we call $f$ the \t{parameterizer} and we call $\set{p^{(\theta )}}_{\theta  \in \Theta}$ the \t{parameterized family}.
A \t{parameterized conditional distribution} is an ordered pair whose first coordinate is a function from $X$ to $\Theta$ and whose second coordinate is a family of distributions on $X$ with parameter set $\Theta$.
For a particular choice of parameterizer and family, it induces a conditional distribution.

Since all conditional distributions are functionally parametrizable (consider $\set{q(\cdot , \xi )}_{\xi  \in X}$ with parameters $X$ and identity parameterizer), we are interested in parameterizers and parameterized families that are simple.
Said differently, we are interested in approximating a conditional distribution by selecting an appropriate parameterizer and parameterized family.

If $\set{f_{\phi }: X \to \Theta}_{\phi  \in \Phi}$ is a family of functions and $\set{q^{(\theta )}}$ is a family of distributions, then $\set{p^{(\phi )}: X \times Z \to \R }_{\phi }$ defined by $p^{(\phi )}(\cdot , \zeta ) \equiv q^{f_\phi (\zeta )}$ is a conditional distribution family called a \t{functionally parameterized conditional distribution family}.
In other words, by selecting some parameters $\phi $, we induce a conditional distribution $p^{(\phi )}: X \times Z \to \R $

We similarly define \t{parameterized conditional densities} and \t{functionally parameterized conditional density families}.

\subsection*{Basic example}

Let $Z = \set{1, 2}$ and $X = \R $. Let $f: \set{1, 2} \to \R  \times \R _+$ be defined by $f(1) = (\mu _1, \sigma _1)$ and $f(2) = (\mu _2, \sigma _2)$.
Let $\set{g^{(\theta )}}_{\theta }$ be the normal family.
Then $(f, \set{g^{(\theta )}})$ is a \t{functionally parameterized conditional density}.\footnote{Future editions will modify.}
