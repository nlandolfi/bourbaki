§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We extend integrability to complex functions.

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬measurable❭ complex-valued function on a measurable space
    is one whose real and imaginary parts are both measurable. ⦉

  ‖ An ❬integrable❭ complex-valued function on a measurable space
    is one whose real and imaginary parts are both integrable. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬integral❭ of a integrable complex-valued function on a
    measurable space is the complex number whose real part is
    the integral of the real part of the function and whose
    imaginary part is the integral imaginary part of the function. ⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ ⦉

  ‖ be a measure space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $C$ denote the set ⦉

  ‖ of complex numbers. ⦉

  ‖ Let $f: X → C$ ⦉

  ‖ be a function. ⦉

  ‖ $f$ is measurable ⦉

  ‖ if $\re(f)$ and $\im(f)$ ⦉

  ‖ are measurable. ⦉

  ‖ $f$ is integrable if ⦉

  ‖ $\re(f)$ and $\im(f)$ ⦉

  ‖ is integrable. ⦉

  ‖ If $f$ is integrable, ⦉

  ‖ we denote its integral ⦉

  ‖ by $∈t f dμ$. ⦉

  ‖ We have defined it by:
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ ∫ f dμ = ∈t \re(f)dμ + ∫ \im(f) dμ. ⦉

§ Results ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ A linear combination ⦉

  ‖ of two integrable complex-valued ⦉

  ‖ functions is an integrable ⦉

  ‖ complex-valued function. ⦉
</statement>
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ The integral is a linear ⦉

  ‖ operator on the vector space ⦉

  ‖ of integrable complex-valued ⦉

  ‖ functions. ⦉
</statement>
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ The absolute value of the integral of a complex-valued
    function is smaller than the integral of the absolute value
    of the function. ⦉
  <proof>
    ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ be a measure space. ⦉

    ‖ Let $f: X → 𝗖$ integrable. ⦉

    ‖ There exists $α ∈ C$ with $\Cmod{α} = 1$ such that
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ \Cmod{∈t f dμ} = α ∈t f dμ. ⦉
      ⦉⦉

    ‖ Since the integral is homogenous,
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ \begin{aligned} ⦉

        ‖ \Cmod{∫ f dμ} ⦉

        ‖ ＆= ∫ α f dμ ⦉

        ‖ ＆= ∫ \re(α f) dμ + i ∫ \im(α f)dμ. ⦉

        ‖ \end{aligned} ⦉
      ⦉

      ‖ Since $𝗖mod{∫ f dμ}$ is real, $∫ \im(α f) dμ = 0$, so
        ◇ ⦊
          ‖ \begin{aligned} ⦉

          ‖ \Cmod{∈t f dμ} ⦉

          ‖ ＆= ∫ \re(α f) dμ ⦉

          ‖ ＆≤ ∫ \abs{α f} dμ ⦉

          ‖ ＆= ∫ \Cmod{f} dμ, ⦉

          ‖ \end{aligned} ⦉
        ⦉
        since $\re(z) ≤ \Cmod{z}$ for all complex numbers $z$
        and $\Cmod{α} = 1$. ⦉⦉
