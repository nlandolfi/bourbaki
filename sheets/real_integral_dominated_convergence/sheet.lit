§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ An integral is a limit. ⦉

  ‖ When can we exchange ⦉

  ‖ this limit with another? ⦉

  ‖ We give a first result ⦉

  ‖ in the search for sufficient ⦉

  ‖ conditions to do so. ⦉
⦉

§ Result ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ When context is clear, we refer to the following proposition
    as the ❬dominated convergence theorem❭. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ The integral ⦉

    ‖ of the almost everywhere limit ⦉

    ‖ of a sequence ⦉

    ‖ of measurable, ⦉

    ‖ extended-real-valued, ⦉

    ‖ almost-everywhere bounded ⦉

    ‖ functions is the ⦉

    ‖ limit of the sequence ⦉

    ‖ of integrals of the functions. ⦉

  <proof>
    ¶ ⦊
      ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ ⦉

      ‖ be a measure space. ⦉

      ‖ Let $f: X → \eri$ be a ⦉

      ‖ $𝒜$-measurable function. ⦉

      ‖ Let $\seqt{f}: → \eri$ ⦉

      ‖ a $𝒜$-measurable function ⦉

      ‖ for every natural number $n$ so that ⦉

      ‖ $\seq{f}$ converges almost everywhere ⦉

      ‖ to $f$. ⦉

      ‖ Let $g: X → \nneri$ be an ⦉

      ‖ integrable function which ⦉

      ‖ dominates $f_n$ almost everywhere ⦉

      ‖ for each $n$. ⦉

      ‖ We want to show that:
        ◇ ⦊
          ‖ ∫f dμ = \lim_{n} ∫f_n dμ. ⦉
