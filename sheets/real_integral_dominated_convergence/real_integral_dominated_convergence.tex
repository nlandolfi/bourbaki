\stitle{
  Real Integral
  Dominated Convergence
}

\ssection{Why}

An integral is a limit.
When can we exchange
this limit with another?
We give a first result
in the search for sufficient
conditions to do so.

\ssection{Result}

When context is clear,
we refer to the following
proposition as the
\ct{dominated convergence theorem}{dominatedconvergencetheorem}.

\begin{prop}

The integral
of the almost everywhere limit
of a sequence
of measurable,
extended-real-valued,
almost-everywhere bounded
functions is the
limit of the sequence
of integrals of the functions.

\begin{proof}

Let $(X, \mathcal{A}, \mu)$
be a measure space.
Let $f: X \to \eri$ be a
$\mathcal{A}$-measurable function.
Let $\seqt{f}: \to \eri$
a $\mathcal{A}$-measurable function
for every natural number $n$ so that
$\seq{f}$ converges almost everywhere
to $f$.
Let $g: X \to \nneri$ be an
integrable function which
dominates $f_n$ almost everywhere
for each $n$.
We want to show that:
\[
  \int f d\mu = \lim_{n} \int f_n d\mu.
\]

\end{proof}

\end{prop}
