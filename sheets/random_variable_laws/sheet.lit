§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We name the image measures of real-valued random variables. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬law❭ of a random variable is the image measure (see ␣
    <a href='/sheets/image_measures'>
      ‖ Image Measures ⦉
    </a>
    ) of the probability measure under the random variable. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ For example, if the random variable is real-valued we use
    the topological sigma algebra of the real numbers and the
    law is the image measure on $𝗥$ induced by the probability
    measure. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜)$ and $(Y, ℬ)$ be two measurable spaces. ⦉

  ‖ Let $f: X → Y$ be a random variable. Let $μ: 𝒜 → \nneri$
    be a probability measure. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the law of $f$ by $\rvlaw{μ}{f}$. ⦉
