\ssection{Why}

We name the image measures of real-valued random variables.

\ssection{Definition}

The \t{law} of a random variable is the image measure (see \sheetref{image_measures}{Image Measures}) of the probability measure under the random variable.

For example, if the random variable is real-valued we use the topological sigma algebra of the real numbers and the law is the image measure on $\R$ induced by the probability measure.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(X, \mathcal{A})$ and $(Y, \mathcal{B})$ be two measurable spaces.
Let $f: X \to Y$ be a random variable.  Let $\mu: \mathcal{A} \to \nneri$ be a probability measure.
We denote the law of $f$ by $\rvlaw{\mu}{f}$.
