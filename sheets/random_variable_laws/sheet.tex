\section*{Why}

We name the image measures of real-valued random variables.

\section*{Definition}

The \t{law} of a random variable is the \sheetref{image_measures}{image measure}of the \sheetref{probability_measures}{probability measure}under the \sheetref{random_variables}{random variable}.

For example, if the random variable is real-valued we use the topological sigma algebra of the real numbers and the law is the image measure on $\R $ induced by the probability measure.

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $(X, \mathcal{A} )$ and $(Y, \mathcal{B} )$ be two measurable spaces.
Let $f: X \to Y$ be a random variable. Let $\mu : \mathcal{A} \to \nneri$ be a probability measure.
We denote the law of $f$ by $\rvlaw{\mu }{f}$.
