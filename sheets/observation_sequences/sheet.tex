\section*{Why}

We want language for recording the elements of some set that appear at regular intervals of time.

\section*{Definition}

Let $A$ be a set.
An \t{observation sequence} (or \t{time series}) in $A$ is a mapping $a: \Z  \to A$.

If $A = \R ^d$ in which case we call $a$ a \t{vector-valued observation sequence} or \t{vector-valued time series}.

\section*{Examples}

Examples include temperature readings, seismograph readings, sunspot numbers, export quantities, and so on.

\section*{Time invariance}

The most basic assumption we can make is that the observation sequence $a$ exhibits some regularity over time.
This assumption is naturally related to the assumption of time-invariance in physical laws.\footnote{Future editions will expand on this discussion.}
