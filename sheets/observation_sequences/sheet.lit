§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want language for recording the elements of some set
    that appear at regular intervals of time. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A$ be a set. ⦉

  ‖ An ❬observation sequence❭ (or ❬time series❭) in $A$ is a
    mapping $a: 𝗭 → A$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ If $A = 𝗥^d$ in which case we call $a$ a ❬vector-valued
    observation sequence❭ or ❬vector-valued time series❭. ⦉
⦉

§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Examples include temperature readings, seismograph readings,
    sunspot numbers, export quantities, and so on. ⦉
⦉

§ Time invariance ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The most basic assumption we can make is that the
    observation sequence $a$ exhibits some regularity over time. ⦉

  ‖ This assumption is naturally related to the assumption of
    time-invariance in physical laws.
