\section*{Definition}

A matrix is \t{upper triangular} if all its entries below the diagonal are zero.
A matrix is \t{lower triangular} if all its entries above the diagonal are zero.
If, in addition, the diagonal is zero, then the matrix is \t{strictly upper triangular} and \t{strictle lower triangular} respectively.

A \t{triangular} matrix is either upper or lower triangular.
A \t{strictly triangular} matrix is either strictly upper triangular or strictly lower triangular.

A \t{unit triangular matrix} is a triangular matrix (upper or lower) whose diagonal entries are one.
Somtimes such matrices are called \t{unitriangular} (a \t{unitriangular matrix}).
So we speak of \t{lower unit triangular}, \t{upper unit triangular}, \t{lower unitriangular} and \t{lower unitriangular} matrices.

\section*{Other terminology}

Some authors call lower triangular matrices \t{left triangular} and upper triangular matrices \t{right triangular}.
Historically, some authors have called triangular matrices \t{semidiagonal}.
