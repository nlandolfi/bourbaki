§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to talk about how a function ⦉

  ‖ of multiple real-valued arguments ⦉

  ‖ changes with respect to changes ⦉

  ‖ in its arguments.

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $f: 𝗥^d → 𝗥$ ⦉

  ‖ For $i = 1,…,d$, the ❬$i$th partial derivative❭ of $f$ is
    the function $g_i: 𝗥^d → 𝗥$ defined by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ g_i(x) = \lim_{h → 0} \frac{f(x + he_i) - f(x)}{h} ⦉
    ⦉
    for each $x ∈ 𝗥^d$. ⦉
⦉

§ Gradient ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬gradient❭ of a multivariate function is the
    vector-valued function whose $i$th component is the the
    partial derivative of the function with respect to its $i$th
    argument. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $f: 𝗥^n → 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ The gradient of $f$ is frequently denoted $∇f$. ⦉

  ‖ It is understood that $(∇f) ∈ 𝗥^d → 𝗥^d$. ⦉

  ‖ An alternative notation is to use that similar for single
    derivatives and to denote the gradient (sometimes called
    derivative) of $f$ by $f'$ (assuming it exists). ⦉

  ‖ It is important to here note that although when $g: 𝗥 →
    𝗥$, $g' ∈ (𝗥 → 𝗥)$, (and so is another function from and
    to reals) when $f: 𝗥^d → 𝗥$, $f' ∈ 𝗥^d → 𝗥^d$, and so is
    a vector-valued (not a real-valued) function. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ There is (unfortunately) much notation for the individual
    partial derivatives; most of which we shall not (fortunately)
    have occasion to use in these sheets. ⦉

  ‖ One popular usage is the use of the $∂$ symbol, read aloud
    as “partial.” ⦉

  ‖ For example, if $f: 𝗥^2 → 𝗥$ is a function of two
    arguments, each being referred to as $x$ and $y$, then $∂_x
    f$ denotes the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$
    and $∂_y f$ denotes the partial derivative of $f$ with
    respect to $y$. ⦉

  ‖ It is understood that $(∂_x f) ∈ 𝗥^d → 𝗥$. and likewise
    for $∂_y f$. ⦉

  ‖ Another popular usage is $∂f/∂x$ for $∂_x f$ and $∂f/∂y$
    for $∂_y f$. ⦉

  ‖ We will almost exclusively prefer the gradient notation. ⦉
