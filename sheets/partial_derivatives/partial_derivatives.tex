\stitle{Partial Derivatives}

\ssection{Why}

We want to talk about a function
of multiple real-valued arguments
changes with respect to changes
in its arguments.

\ssection{Definition}

Consider a real-valued function on
$d$-dimensional space.
For $i = 1, \dots, d$,
Fix a point $x$.
consider the limit of a sequence
of quotients of the difference
of the result of that function
at a point
