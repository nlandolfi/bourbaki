\section*{Why}

We want to talk about how a function
of multiple real-valued arguments
changes with respect to changes
in its arguments.\footnote{Future editions will modify this sheet.}

\section*{Definition}

Let $f: \R ^d \to \R $
For $i = 1,\dots ,d$, the \t{$i$th partial derivative} of $f$ is the function $g_i: \R ^d \to \R $ defined by
\[
g_i(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + he_i) - f(x)}{h}
\]
for each $x \in \R ^d$.

\section*{Gradient}

The \t{gradient} of a multivariate function is the vector-valued function whose $i$th component is the the partial derivative of the function with respect to its $i$th argument.

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $f: \R ^n \to \R $.
The gradient of $f$ is frequently denoted $\nabla f$.
It is understood that $(\nabla f) \in \R ^d \to \R ^d$.
An alternative notation is to use that similar for single derivatives and to denote the gradient (sometimes called derivative) of $f$ by $f'$ (assuming it exists).
It is important to here note that although when $g: \R  \to \R $, $g' \in (\R  \to \R )$, (and so is another function from and to reals) when $f: \R ^d \to \R $, $f' \in \R ^d \to \R ^d$, and so is a vector-valued (not a real-valued) function.

There is (unfortunately) much notation for the individual partial derivatives; most of which we shall not (fortunately) have occasion to use in these sheets.
One popular usage is the use of the $\partial $ symbol, read aloud as ``partial.''
For example, if $f: \R ^2 \to \R $ is a function of two arguments, each being referred to as $x$ and $y$, then $\partial _x f$ denotes the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$ and $\partial _y f$ denotes the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $y$.
It is understood that $(\partial _x f) \in \R ^d \to \R $. and likewise for $\partial _y f$.
Another popular usage is $\partial f/\partial x$ for $\partial _x f$ and $\partial f/\partial y$ for $\partial _y f$.
We will almost exclusively prefer the gradient notation.
