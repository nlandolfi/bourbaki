§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We generalize the notion of sets and functions. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬category❭ is a set of ⦉

  ‖ objects together with a set of ⦉

  ‖ ❬category maps❭ for each ⦉

  ‖ ordered pair of objects. ⦉

  ‖ The set of maps has a binary operation called ⦉

  ‖ ❬category composition❭, ⦉

  ‖ whose induced algebra is associative and contains identities. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ As the fundamental example, consider the category whose ⦉

  ‖ objects are sets and whose maps are functions. ⦉

  ‖ The sets are the objects of the category. ⦉

  ‖ The functions are the maps. ⦉

  ‖ The rule of composition is ordinary function composition. ⦉

  ‖ The map identities are the identity functions. ⦉

  ‖ We call this category the ❬category of sets❭. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Our notation for categories is guided by our generalizing
    the notions of set and functions. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote categories with upper-case latin letters ⦉

  ‖ in script; for example, $𝒞$. ⦉

  ‖ We read $𝒞$ aloud as “script C.” ⦉

  ‖ Upper case latin letters remind that the category is a set
    of objects. ⦉

  ‖ The script form reminds that these objects may themselves be
    sets. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the objects of a category by upper-case latin
    letters, ⦉

  ‖ for example $A, B, C$; an allusion to the idea that these
    generalize sets. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the set of maps for an ordered pair of objects
    $(A, B)$ ⦉

  ‖ by $A → B$; an allusion to the function notation. ⦉

  ‖ We denote members of $A → B$ using lower case latin
    letters, ⦉

  ‖ for example $f, g, h$; an allusion to our function notation. ⦉
