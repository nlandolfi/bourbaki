\stitle{Real Limiting Bounds}

\ssection{Why}

We can think of a limit
as existing when the limit
of upper bounds and lower bounds
on final parts of the sequence
coincide.

\ssection{Definition}

The
\ct{limit superior}{limitsuperior}
of a sequence of real numbers
is the limit of the sequence
of suprema of final parts
of the sequence.
Similarly, the
\ct{limit inferior}{limitinferior}
of a sequence of real numbers
is the limit of the sequence
of infima of final parts
of the sequence.

The limit of the sequence
exists if and only if the
If the limit superior and the
limit inferior coincide,
then the sequence has
a limit which is defined
to be the limiting value of
each of those two sequences.
