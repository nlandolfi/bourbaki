§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We can think of a limit as existing when the limit of
    upper bounds and lower bounds on final parts of the sequence
    coincide. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬limit superior❭ of a sequence of real numbers is the
    limit of the sequence of suprema of final parts of the
    sequence. ⦉

  ‖ Similarly, the ❬limit inferior❭ of a sequence of real
    numbers is the limit of the sequence of infima of final
    parts of the sequence. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The limit of the sequence exists if and only if the limit
    superior and the limit inferior coincide, then the sequence
    has a limit which is defined to be the limiting value of
    each of those two sequences. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the limit superior of a sequence $a_n$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \limsup_{n → ∞} x_n \quad \text{ or } \quad
        \overline{\lim}_{n → ∞} x_n, ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Similarly, we denote the limit inferior by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \liminf_{n → ∞} x_n \quad \text{ or } \underline{\lim}_{n
        → ∞} x_n ⦉
    ⦉⦉

§ Properties ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Suppose $x: 𝗡 → 𝗥$ is a sequence. ⦉

  ‖ Then,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \liminf x_n = - \limsup (-x_n) ⦉
    ⦉⦉
</statement>
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Suppose $x: 𝗡 → 𝗥$ is a sequence. ⦉

  ‖ Then $\limsup x_n = \liminf x_n = ℓ$ if and only if $\lim
    x_n = ℓ$. ⦉

  ‖ Here $ℓ ∈ 𝗥$. ⦉
