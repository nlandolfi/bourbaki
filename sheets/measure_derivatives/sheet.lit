  ‖ The function $f ≡ 0$ is in $ℱ$, since it is a measurable
    simple function whose integral over every measureable set is
    zero. ⦉
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ If $f_1$ and $f_2$ are in $ℱ$, then $f_1 \vee f_2$ is
      in $ℱ$. ⦉

    ‖ To check, let $A ∈ 𝒜$, and define the sets $A_1 =
      \Set{x ∈ A}{f_1(x) > f_2(x)}$ and $A_2 = \Set{x ∈
      A}{f_1(x) ≤ f_2(x)}$. ⦉

      for each $A ∈ 𝒜$. ⦉

    ‖ Since $∫_A g_n ≤ ν(A)$, ⦉

    ‖ so too is the limit and thus ⦉

    ‖ so too is $∫_A g$. ⦉

    ‖ Thus, $g ∈ ℱ$. ⦉

    ‖ If $ν_0$ is identically zero, then there is no gap. ⦉
  ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Suppose there is a gap: then there exists a measurable
      set with strictly positive measure under $ν_0$. ⦉

    ‖ Since the base set contains this set, and measures are
      monotone, the base set must have stricty positive measure. ⦉

    ‖ Since $μ$ is finite, there exists a natural number $n$ so
