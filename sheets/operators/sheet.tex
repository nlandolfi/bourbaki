\section*{Definition}

An \t{operator} is a \textit{linear} tranformation where the codomain is the domain.
An operator is just a linear transformation with a particular domain and codomain, just as a transformation is is just a function on and to vector spaces.

\subsection*{Notation}

Suppose $V$ is a vector space.
We usually abbreviate the notation for the set of operators to $\mathcal{L} (V)$ from $\mathcal{L} (V, V)$.
