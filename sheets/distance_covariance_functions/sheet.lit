§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ It is common to consider random functions whose domain is
    time, space, or $n$-dimensional space. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space. A ❬distance covariance
    function❭ $k: X ×X → 𝗥$ is a covariance function satisfying ⦉
  ◇ ⦊
    ‖ k(x, y) > k(x, y) \iff d(x, y) < d(x, y). ⦉
  ⦉

  ‖ In other words, the covariance decreases as the distance
    between the arguments decreases. ⦉
⦉

§ Example: squared exponential ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $k: X ×X → 𝗥$ be defined by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ k(x, y) = \exp(-d(x, y)). ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Then $k$ is a distance covariance function. ⦉

  ‖ It is often called the ❬squared exponential covariance
    function❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $α, σ ∈ 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ Define $k': X ×X → 𝗥$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ k'(x, y) = α\exp(-d(x, y)/σ^2) ⦉
    ⦉
    then $k'$ is still a covariance function. ⦉

  ‖ In this context $σ$ is often referred to as the
    ❬characteristic length-scale❭ of the process. ⦉

  ‖ The scalar $α$ is sometimes called a “prefactor” that
    “controls” the “overall variance.” ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $(X, d) = (𝗥^n, \norm{·})$. ⦉

  ‖ Then the squared exponential covariance function
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ α\exp(-\norm{x - y”/(2σ^2)) ⦉
    ⦉
    is sometimes called the ❬radial basis function❭ or ❬gaussian
    covariance function❭.
    † ⦊
      ‖ For reasons that will be included in future editions. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Also called an ❬exponentiated quadratic kernel❭. ⦉
