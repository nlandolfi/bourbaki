\ssection{Why}

We name a set together with an operation.

\ssection{Definition}

An \t{algebra} is an ordered pair whose first element is a non-empty set and whose second element is an operation on that set.
The \t{ground set} of the algebra is the set on which the operation is defined.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $A$ be a non-empty set and let $+: A \times A \to A$ be an operation on $A$.
As usual, we denote the ordered pair by $(A, +)$.
