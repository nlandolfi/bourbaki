\ssection{Why}

We name a set
together with an operation.

\ssection{Definition}

An \ct{algebra}{algebra} is
an ordered pair whose first
element is a non-empty set
and whose second element
is an operation on that set.
The
\ct{ground set}{groundset}
of the algebra is
the set on which the operation
is defined.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $A$ be a non-empty set and
let $+: A \times A \to A$ be
an operation on $A$.
As usual, we denote the ordered
pair by $(A, +)$.
