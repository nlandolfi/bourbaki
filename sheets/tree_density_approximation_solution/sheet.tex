\ssection{Why}

What can we say about tree density approximation? It turns out to be similar to what we can say about tree distribution approximation.

\ssection{Results}

\begin{prop}
  Let $g: \R^n \to \R$ be a density.
  Let $T$ be
  a tree on $\set{1, \dots, n}$.
  Let $p_j$ be
  the parent of vertex $j$ for the $T$ rooted
  at vertex $i$, $j = 1,\dots,n$ and $j \neq i$.
  Then the density $f: \R^d \to \R$ defined by
  \[
    f = g_i \prod_{j \neq i} g_{j \mid p_j}
  \]
  achieves minimum differential entropy relative to $g$ among
  all densities which factor according to $T$.
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}
  Let $g: \R^n \to \R$ be a density.
  A tree $T$ is a solution to the problem above
  if and only if it is a maximum spanning
  tree of the differential mutual information graph of $g$.
\end{prop}
