§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We extend the notion of a monoid homomorphism to groups. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $G$ and $G'$ are the ground sets of groups and $f:
    G → G'$ is a␣
    <a href='/sheets/monoid_homomorphisms.html'>
      ‖ monoid homomorphism ⦉
    </a>
    . ⦉

  ‖ Then we call $f$ a ❬group homomorphism❭.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will handle ❬ring homomorphism❭ and ❬field
        homomorphism❭ similarly. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

§§ Inverses ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $f: G → G'$ is a group-homomorphism, then
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ f(\inv{x}) = \inv{f(x)} \quad \text{for all } x ∈ G ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ To see this, denote the units of $G$ and $G'$ by $e$ and
    $e'$ respectively and deduce
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ e' = f(e) = f(x\inv{x}) = f(x)f(\inv{x}) ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

§§ Sufficient condition for group homomorphism ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Futhermore, for groups, the condition that $f$ be a
    homomorphism can be simplified. ⦉

  ‖ Suppose $f: G → G'$ is any ‹function› such that
    <equation id='grouphomomorphismsufficientcondition'>
      ‖ f(xy) = f(x)f(y) \quad \text{for all } x, y ∈ G ⦉
    </equation>⦉

  ‖ Recall that for monoids we further required that $f$ map
    the unit of $G$ to the unit of $G'$. ⦉

  ‖ For groups, we can deduce this property from Equation
    \eqref{grouphomomorphismsufficientcondition}. ⦉

  ‖ Then we have $f(e) = e'$. ⦉

  ‖ To see this, observe that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ f(e) = f(ee) = f(e)f(e) ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Left multiplying by $\inv{f(e)}$ gives
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ e' = f(e) ⦉
    ⦉
    as desired. ⦉
⦉

§§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $(G, ·)$ is a group. ⦉

  ‖ Consider the additive monoid $(𝗭, +)$ of the integer numbers
    under addition. ⦉

  ‖ Define the function $f: 𝗭 → G$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ f(n) = x^n \quad \text{for all } n ∈ 𝗭 ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Then $f$ is a group homomorphism. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $(G, ·)$ is a ‹commutative› group and let $n ∈ 𝗭$
    be a fixed integer. ⦉

  ‖ The function $f: G → G$ defined by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ f(x) = x^n \quad \text{for all } x ∈ G ⦉
    ⦉
    is a homomorphism called the ❬power map❭. ⦉

  ‖ One can also easily verify that the map $g: G → G$
    defined by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ g(x) = \inv{x} \quad \text{for all } x ∈ G ⦉
    ⦉
    is a homomorphism. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $\set{G_{i}}_{i ∈ I}$ is a family of groups and
    define $G = ∏ G_i$. ⦉

  ‖ The function $p_i: G → G_i$ defined by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ p_i(x) = x(i) \quad \text{for all } x ∈ G ⦉
    ⦉
    a ‹projection›, is a homomorphism. ⦉
⦉

§§ Properties ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose that $G$, $G''$, and $G'''$ are group ground sets
    and that $f: G → G'$ and $g: G' → G''$ are homomorphisms. ⦉

  ‖ Then their composition $g ∘ f$ is a homomorphism. ⦉

  ‖ If $f$ and $g$ are isomorphisms, then so is $g ∘ f$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ In addition to the above observations, notice that if $f$
    is an isomorphism then so is $\inv{f}$. ⦉

  ‖ Given a group $(G, ·)$, define $\Aut(G)$ to be the set of
    all automorphisms. ⦉

  ‖ The foregoing observations imply that $(\Aut(G), ∘)$ is a
    group. ⦉
