§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬probability density function❭ of a real-valued random
    variable is a measurable function from the real numbers to
    real numbers which is (a) non-negative and (b) the integral
    of the function over a cover-length-measurable set with
    respect to the cover measure to the cover length is the
    probability that the random variable takes value in that set. ⦉

  ‖ We often abbreviate probability density function as ❬p.d.f❭,
    read aloud as “pdf”. ⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ be a probability space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $f$ be a real-valued random variable on $X$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $λ$ denote the cover length. ⦉

  ‖ A function $g: 𝗥 → 𝗥$ is a probability density of $f$ if
    $g ≥ 0$ and of $f$ if
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ μ(\Set*{x ∈ X}{f(x) ∈ A}) = ∫_{A} g dλ. ⦉

§§ Uniqueness ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ If a probability density function exists, it is unique (up
    to almost everywhere). ⦉
