\section*{Definition}

The \t{correlation} between two integrable real-valued random variables with non-zero variance is the quotient of their covariance with the product of their standard deviations.

Two integrable real-valued random variables are \t{uncorrelated}
if their covariance is zero.
We can speak of uncorrelated random variables who have zero variance, although in this case their correlation is undefined.

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $f$ and $g$ be two integrable real-valued random variables with $fg$ integrable.
% <div data-littype='run'> Denote the correlation of $f$ with $g$ 0 by $\cor(f, g)$. </div>
%  

% <div data-littype='run'> We defined it:
%    <div data-littype='displaymath'>
%     <div data-littype='run'> \cor(f, g) = \frac{\cov(f,g)}{\std(f)\std(g)}. </div>
%    </div></div>
