\section*{Definition}

The \t{correlation} between two integrable real-valued random variables with non-zero variance is the quotient of their covariance with the product of their standard deviations.

Two integrable real-valued random variables are \t{uncorrelated}
if their covariance is zero.
We can speak of uncorrelated random variables who have zero variance, although in this case their correlation is undefined.

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $f$ and $g$
be two integrable
real-valued
random variables
with $fg$ integrable.
Denote the correlation
of $f$ with $g$
by $\cor(f, g)$.
We defined it:
    \[
\cor(f, g) = \frac{\cov(f,g)}{\std(f)\std(g)}.
    \]
