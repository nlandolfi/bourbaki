\ssection{Definition}

The \ct{correlation}{}
between two
integrable real-valued
random variables
with non-zero variance
is the quotient of
their covariance
with the product of
their
standard deviations.

Two
integrable real-valued
random variables
are
\ct{uncorrelated}{uncorrelated}
if their covariance is zero.
We can speak of
uncorrelated random
variables who have zero variance,
although in this case their
correlation is undefined.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $f$ and $g$
be two integrable
real-valued
random variables
with $fg$ integrable.
Denote the correlation
of $f$ with $g$
by $\cor(f, g)$.
We defined it:
\[
  \cor(f, g) = \frac{\cov(f,g)}{\std{f}\std{g}}.
\]
