¬ß Why ‚¶â
¬∂ ‚¶ä
  ‚Äñ Suppose a manufacturer has raw materials, and production
    processes by which she can convert raw materials into
    finished goods. ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ How should she ‚Äπallocate‚Ä∫ the raw materials among the
    finished goods to maximize revenue. ‚¶â
‚¶â

¬ß Model ‚¶â
¬∂ ‚¶ä
  ‚Äñ We model the quantities of $m$ raw materials available to
    the manufacturer by $m$ real numbers, which we denote $q_1,
    ‚Ä¶, q_m ‚àà ùó•_+$. ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ We suppose that there is a correspondence, $f_i: ùó•_+ ‚Üí
    ùó•_+^m$, which models the quantities of the $m$ raw materials
    that will be needed for the $i$th finished good. ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ In other words, $f_i(x)$ is the ‚ù¨bill of materials‚ù≠ to
    produce quantity $x$ of the $i$th finished good. ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ We suppose finished good $i$ can be sold for a price $p_i$
    per unit. ‚¶â
‚¶â

¬∂ ‚¶ä
  ‚Äñ We formulate the following optimization problem. ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ Given a supply of raw materials $q_1, ‚Ä¶, q_m$, find the
    quantities $x_1, ‚Ä¶, x_n$ to
    ‚óá ‚¶ä
      ‚Äñ \begin{aligned} ‚¶â

      ‚Äñ \text{ maximize } \quad & \textstyle ‚àë_{i = 1}^{n} p_i
        x_i ·ú∂ ‚¶â

      ‚Äñ \text{ subject to } \quad & \textstyle ‚àë_{i = 1}^{n}
        f_i(x_i) ‚â§ q ·ú∂ ‚¶â

      ‚Äñ \text{ and } \quad & x ‚â• 0 ‚¶â

      ‚Äñ \end{aligned} ‚¶â
    ‚¶â‚¶â

  ‚Äñ This is sometimes called an ‚ù¨allocation problem‚ù≠ or
    ‚ù¨manufacturing problem‚ù≠. ‚¶â
‚¶â

¬∂ ‚¶ä
  ‚Äñ ‚ÄπLinear simplication.‚Ä∫ ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ In the case that $f_i$ is modeled (or idealized) as a
    linear function, we obtain a ‚Äπlinear optimization problem‚Ä∫. ‚¶â
