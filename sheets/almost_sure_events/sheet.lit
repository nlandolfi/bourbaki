§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We discuss negligible sets in the langauge of probability
    theory.

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(Ω, 𝒜, 𝗣)$ be a probability space. ⦉

  ‖ An event $A ∈ 𝒜$ happens ❬almost surely❭ (or ❬almost
    certainly❭ or ❬almost always❭) if $𝗣(A) = 1$ (equivalently, if
    $𝗣(Ω ∖ A) = 0$. ⦉

  ‖ Conversely, an event $B ⊂ Ω$ happens ❬almost never❭ if
    $𝗣(B) = 0$. ⦉
