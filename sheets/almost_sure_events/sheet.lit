§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $(Ω, 𝒜, 𝗣)$ is a probability space. ⦉

  ‖ An event $A ∈ 𝒜$ happens ❬almost surely❭ (or ❬almost
    certainly❭, ❬almost always❭) if $𝗣(A) = 1$. ⦉

  ‖ (An equivalent condition is that $𝗣(Ω ∖ A) = 0$.) ⦉

  ‖ Conversely, an event $B ⊂ Ω$ happens ❬almost never❭ if
    $𝗣(B) = 0$. ⦉
