\ssection{Why}

We want a notion
of distance between
elements of the real
line.

\ssection{Definition}

We define a function
mapping a real number
to its length from zero.

\ssubsection{Notation}

We denote the absolute value
of a real number $a \in \R$ by $\abs{a}$.
Thus $\abs{\cdot}: \R \to \R$ can be viewed
as a real-valued function on the real numbers
which is nonnegative.
