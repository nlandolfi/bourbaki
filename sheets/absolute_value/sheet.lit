§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want a notion of distance between elements of the real
    line. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  <!-- We define a function which maps the real numbers onto the nonnegative real numbers.-->

  ‖ The ❬absolute value❭ of a real number is the greater of
    itself and its additive inverse. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, if $x$ is positive, then the absolute value
    of $x$ is $x$. ⦉

  ‖ If $x$ is negative, then the absolute value of $x$ is $-x$
    (a positive real number). ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the absolute value of a real number $x ∈ 𝗥$ by
    $\abs{x}$. ⦉

  <!--Thus $\abs{·}: 𝗥 → 𝗥$ can be viewed as a real-valued function on the real numbers which is nonnegative.-->
⦉

§§ Distance ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The absolute value can be interpreted as the distance
    between the point corresponding to the real number and the
    point corresponding to 0. ⦉

  ‖ We can generalize this idea. ⦉

  ‖ Consider $x, y ∈ 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ If $x > y$, then $x - y > 0$ and so the distance
    between the corresponding points is $x - y$. ⦉

  ‖ If $x < y$ then $y - x > 0$, and so the distance is $y
    - x$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The observation is that $\abs{-x} = \abs{x}$. ⦉

  ‖ So
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \abs{y - x} = \abs{-(x - y)} = \abs{x-y}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ So if we just care about the distance between the points
    corresponding to $y$ and $x$, we can consider $\abs{x - y}$,
    without regard for their order. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, the function $(x, y) ↦ \abs{x - y}$ is
    symmetric in $x$ and $y$. ⦉
