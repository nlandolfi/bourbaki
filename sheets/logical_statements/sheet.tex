\s{Why}

We want symbols for \say{and}, \say{or}, \say{not}, and for the constructs \say{implies}.

\s{Definition}

In \sheetref{statements}{Statements} we discussed that nouns are names and that we will only use the present tense of the verbs \say{is} and \say{belongs}.
We had statements like ${a}={b}$ (identity) and $a \in A$ (belonging).

We call $=$ and $\in$ \t{relational symbols}.
They say how the objects denoted by a pair of placeholder names relate to each other in the sense of being or belonging.
We call $\_=\_$ and $\_\in\_$ \t{simple statements}.
They denote simple sentences \say{the object denoted by \_ is the object denoted by \_} and \say{the obejct denoted by \_ belongs to the set denoted by \_}.

We want to make more complicated statements.
We want to assert that two primitive statements at once.
Or we want to

We want to connect these statements with the words \say{and} and \say{or} so that we can say more complicated things.
For example $\_ belongs to \_$
We build

A \t{logical statement} is a sequence of symbols, a subset of which are

We want to predict assertions when  w q
We want to
