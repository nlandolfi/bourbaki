\section*{Definition}

A number $n \in \N  $, $n > 1$, is \t{composite} if there exists $m, k \in \N  $ (not necessarily distinct) satisfying $m, k < n$ and
\[
n = m\cdot k
\]
A number which is not composite is called \t{prime}.
Throughout this sheet, ``number'' is an element of $\N  $.
In other words, we exclude the natural number 0.

\section*{Examples}

\textit{The first few primes.}
Since the only number smaller than $2$ is $1$ and $2 \neq 1\cdot 1$, $2$ is the first and smallest prime.
Likewise, $3 \neq 1\cdot 2$, $3 \neq 1\cdot 1$, $3 \neq 2\cdot 2$.
So $3$ is the second smallest prime.

\textit{The first composite.}
Now consider $4$.
Since $4 = 2\cdot 2$ and $2 \leq 4$, 4 is the smallest composite number.
