§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A number $n ∈ 𝗡$, $n > 1$, is ❬composite❭ if there exists
    $m, k ∈ 𝗡$ (not necessarily distinct) satisfying $m, k < n$
    and
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ n = m·k ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ A number which is not composite is called ❬prime❭. ⦉

  ‖ Throughout this sheet, “number” is an element of $𝗡$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, we exclude the natural number 0. ⦉
⦉

§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ ‹The first few primes.› ⦉

  ‖ Since the only number smaller than $2$ is $1$ and $2 ≠
    1·1$, $2$ is the first and smallest prime. ⦉

  ‖ Likewise, $3 ≠ 1·2$, $3 ≠ 1·1$, $3 ≠ 2·2$. ⦉

  ‖ So $3$ is the second smallest prime. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ ‹The first composite.› ⦉

  ‖ Now consider $4$. ⦉

  ‖ Since $4 = 2·2$ and $2 ≤ 4$, 4 is the smallest composite
    number. ⦉
