§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A natural number $n > 1$ is ❬composite❭ if there exists
    natural numbers $m$ and $k$, not necessarily distinct, both
    smaller than $n$ and satisfying
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ n = m·k ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ A number greater than 1 which is not composite is called
    ❬prime❭. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, a prime number is number greater than 1
    which is not the product of two smaller numbers. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Throughout this sheet, the term “number” refers to an
    element of the set $𝗡$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, we exclude the natural number 0. ⦉
⦉

§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ ‹The first few primes.› ⦉

  ‖ Since the only number smaller than $2$ is $1$ and $2 ≠
    1·1$, $2$ is the first and smallest prime. ⦉

  ‖ Likewise, $3 ≠ 1·2$, $3 ≠ 1·1$, $3 ≠ 2·2$. ⦉

  ‖ So $3$ is the second smallest prime. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ ‹The first composite.› ⦉

  ‖ Now consider $4$. ⦉

  ‖ Since $4 = 2·2$ and $2 ≤ 4$, 4 is the smallest composite
    number. ⦉
