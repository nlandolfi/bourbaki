\section*{Why}

We name maps from vectors to scalars.

\section*{Definition}

A \t{functional} is a function from vectors to a field.
It is natural, and common, for the field of scalars to be the base field.

A real-valued functional is \t{non-negative} if its range is a subset of the non-negative real numbers.
A real-valued functional if \t{definite} if the only it maps to zero is the zero element of the vector space.

A real-valued functional on a real or complex vector space is \t{absolutely homogeneous} if the result of a scaled vector is the same as the result of the vector scaled by the absolute value of the scalar.
