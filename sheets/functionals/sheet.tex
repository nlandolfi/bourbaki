\ssection{Why}

We name maps
from vectors to scalars.

\ssection{Definition}

A
\ct{functional}{functional}
is a function from
vectors to a field.
It is natural, and common,
for the field of scalars
to be the base field.

A real-valued functional is
\ct{non-negative}{nonnegativefunctional}
if its
range is a subset of
the non-negative real
numbers.
A real-valued functional if
\ct{definite}{definitefunctional}
if the only it maps to zero is
the zero element of the vector space.

A real-valued functional
on a real or complex
vector space is
\ct{absolutely homogeneous}{absolutelyhomogeneousfunctional}
if the result of a scaled vector
is the same as the result of the vector
scaled by the absolute value of the scalar.
