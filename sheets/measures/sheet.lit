§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We extend our notion of length, area, and volume beyond the
    Lebesgue measure on the product spaces of real numbers. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $𝒜$ is an algebra of sets. ⦉

  ‖ A function $f: 𝒜 → \Rbar_+$ is ❬finitely additive❭ if
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ f(∪_{i = 1}^{n} A_i) = ∑_{i = 1}^{n} f(A_i) \quad
        \text{for all disjoint } A_1, …, A_n ∈ 𝒜 ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Similarly, suppose $ℱ$ is a $σ$-algebra. ⦉

  ‖ Then $f$ is ❬countably additive❭ if
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ f(∪_{i = 1}^{∞} F_i) = ∑_{i =1 }^{∞} f(F_i) \quad
        \text{for all disjoint sequences } \set{F_i}_{i ∈ 𝗡}
        \text{ in } ℱ ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ If, in addition, $f(∅) = 0$, then $f$ is called a
    ❬finitely additive measure❭ or ❬countably additive measure❭
    respectively. ⦉

  ‖ Since a countably additive measure is finitely additive (the
    converse is false!), when we speak of a ❬measure❭ we mean a
    countable additive one. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ When $(X, ℱ)$ is a countably unitable subset algebra and
    $μ: ℱ → \Rbar_+$, then we call $(X, ℱ)$ a ❬measurable
    space❭ and call $(X, ℱ, μ)$ a ❬measure space❭. ⦉

  ‖ The word “space” is natural, since the notion of a measure
    generalized the notion of volume in real space (see␣
    <a href='/sheets/real_space.html'>
      ‖ Real Space ⦉
    </a>
    ␣and␣
    <a href='/sheets/n-dimensional_space.html'>
      ‖ N-Dimensional Space ⦉
    </a>
    ). ⦉

  ‖ We often call $ℱ$ the ❬measurable sets❭. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, a measure space is a triple: a base set,
    a sigma algebra, and a measure. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We often use $μ$ for a measure since it is a mnemonic for
    “measure”. ⦉

  ‖ We often also us $ν$ and $λ$ since these letters are near
    $μ$ in the Greek alphabet. ⦉
⦉

§§ Examples ⦉
<statement type='example'>
  ‖ Let $(A, 𝒜)$ a measurable space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $μ: 𝒜 → [0, +∞]$ such that $μ(A)$ is $\card{A}$ if
    $A$ is finite and $μ(A)$ is $+∞$ otherwise. ⦉

  ‖ Then $μ$ is a measure. ⦉

  ‖ We call $μ$ the ❬counting measure❭. ⦉
</statement>
<statement type='example'>
  ‖ Let $(A, 𝒜)$ measurable. ⦉

  ‖ Fix $a ∈ A$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $μ: 𝒜 → [0, +∞]$ such that $μ(A)$ is $1$ if $a ∈ A$
    and $μ(A)$ is $0$ otherwise. ⦉

  ‖ Then $μ$ is a measure. ⦉

  ‖ We call $μ$ the ❬point mass❭ concentrated at $a$. ⦉
</statement>
<statement type='example'>
  ‖ The Lebesgue measure on the measurable space $(𝗥, ℬ(𝗥))$ is
    a measure. ⦉
</statement>
<statement type='example'>
  ‖ Let $𝒜$ the co-finite algebra on $N$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $μ: 𝒜 → [0, +∞]$ be such that $μ(A)$ is 1 if $A$ is
    infinite or 0 otherwise. ⦉

  ‖ Then $μ$ is a finitely additive measure. ⦉

  ‖ However it is impossible to extend $μ$ to be a countably
    additive measure. ⦉

  ‖ Observe that if $A_n = \set{n}$ the $μ(∪_{n} A_n) = 1$ but
    $∑_{n} μ(A_n) = 0$. ⦉
</statement>
<statement type='example'>
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Let $(A, 𝒜)$ a measurable space. ⦉

    ‖ Let $μ: 𝒜 → [0, +∞]$ be $0$ if $A = ∅$ and $μ(A)$ is
      $+∞$ otherwise. ⦉

    ‖ Then $μ$ is a measure. ⦉
  ⦉
</statement>
<statement type='example'>
  ‖ Let $A$ be set with at least two elements ($\card{A} ≥ 2$). ⦉

  ‖ Let $𝒜 = \powerset{A}$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $μ: 𝒜 → [0, +∞]$ such that $μ(A)$ is $0$ if $A = ∅$
    and $μ(A) = 1$ otherwise. ⦉

  ‖ Then $μ$ is not a measure, nor is $μ$ finitely additive. ⦉
  <proof>
    ‖ Let $B, C ∈ 𝒜$, ⦉

    ‖ $B ∩ C = ∅$ ⦉

    ‖ then using finite additivity ⦉

    ‖ We obtain a contradiction
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ 1 = μ(B ∪ C) ≠ μ(B) + μ(C) = 2 ⦉
      ⦉⦉
  </proof>

    ⦉⦉
</statement>
<statement type='proposition' text='subaddivity'>
  ‖ Suppose $(A, 𝒜, m)$ is a measure space and $\set{A_n} ⊂ 𝒜$
