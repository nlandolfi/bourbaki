§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We extend our notion of length, area, volume beyond the
    Lebesgue measure on the product spaces of real numbers. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ An extended-real-valued non-negative function on an algebra is
    ❬finitely additive❭ if the result of the function applied to
    the union of a disjoint finite family of distinguished sets
    is the sum of the results of the function applied to each
    of the sets individually. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ An extended-real-valued non-negative function on a sigma
    algebra is ❬countably additive❭ if the result of the function
    applied to the union of a disjoint countable family of
    distinguished sets is the limit of the partial sums of the
    results of the function applied to each of the sets
    individually. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬finitely additive measure❭ is an extended-real-valued
    non-negative finitely additive function which associates the
    empty set with the real number $0$. ⦉

  ‖ A ❬countably additive measure❭ is an extended-real-valued
    non-negative countably additive function which associates the
    empty set with the real number $0$. ⦉

  ‖ We call countably additive measures ❬measures❭, for short. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Every countably additive measure is finitely additive. ⦉

  ‖ On the other hand, there exist finitely additive measures
    which are not countable additive. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ In the context of measure, we call a countably unitable
    subset algebra a ❬measurable space❭. ⦉

  ‖ We call the distinguished sets ❬measurable❭ sets. ⦉

  ‖ A ❬measure space❭ is triple. ⦉

  ‖ As a pair, the first two objects are a measurable space. ⦉

  ‖ The third object is a measure defined on the sigma algebra
    of the measurable space. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A$ a set. ⦉

  ‖ Let $𝒜$ a sigma algebra on $A$. ⦉

  ‖ The pair $(A, 𝒜)$ is a measurable space. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $μ: 𝒜 → [0, ∈fty]$ a measure; ⦉

  ‖ thus: ⦉

  ‖ (a) $μ(∅) = 0$ and ⦉

  ‖ (b) for disjoint $\set{A_n} ⊂ 𝒜$, ⦉

  ‖ $μ(∪_{n = 1}^{∞} A_n) = ∑_{n = 1}^{∞} μ(A_n)$ ⦉

  ‖ The triple $(A, 𝒜, μ)$ is a measure space. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We use $μ$ since it is a mnemonic for “measure”. ⦉

  ‖ We often also us $ν$ to denote measures, since it is after
    $μ$ in the Greek alphabet, and $λ$, since it is before $μ$
    in the Greek alphabet. ⦉

§§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ \begin{expl} ⦉

  ‖ Let $(A, 𝒜)$ a measurable space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $μ: 𝒜 → [0, +∞]$ such that $μ(A)$ is $\card{A}$ if
    $A$ is finite and $μ(A)$ is $+∞$ otherwise. ⦉

  ‖ Then $μ$ is a measure. ⦉

  ‖ We call $μ$ the ❬counting measure❭. ⦉

  ‖ \end{expl} ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ \begin{expl} ⦉

  ‖ Let $(A, 𝒜)$ measurable. ⦉

  ‖ Fix $a ∈ A$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $μ: 𝒜 → [0, +∞]$ such that $μ(A)$ is $1$ if $a ∈ A$
    and $μ(A)$ is $0$ otherwise. ⦉

  ‖ Then $μ$ is a measure. ⦉

  ‖ We call $μ$ the ❬point mass❭ concentrated at $a$. ⦉

  ‖ \end{expl} ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ \begin{expl} ⦉

  ‖ The Lebesgue measure on the measurable space $(𝗥, ℬ(𝗥))$ is
    a measure. ⦉

  ‖ \end{expl} ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ \begin{expl} ⦉

  ‖ Let $𝒜$ the co-finite algebra on $N$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $μ: 𝒜 → [0, +∞]$ be such that $μ(A)$ is 1 if $A$ is
    infinite or 0 otherwise. ⦉

  ‖ Then $μ$ is a finitely additive measure. ⦉

  ‖ However it is impossible to extend $μ$ to be a countably
    additive measure. ⦉

  ‖ Observe that if $A_n = \set{n}$ the $μ(∪_{n} A_n) = 1$ but
    $∑_{n} μ(A_n) = 0$. ⦉

  ‖ \end{expl} ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ \begin{expl} ⦉

  ‖ Let $(A, 𝒜)$ a measurable space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $μ: 𝒜 → [0, +∞]$ be $0$ if $A = ∅$ and $μ(A)$ is
    $+∞$ otherwise. ⦉

  ‖ Then $μ$ is a measure. ⦉

  ‖ \end{expl} ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ \begin{expl} ⦉

  ‖ Let $A$ be set with at least two elements ($\card{A} ≥ 2$). ⦉

  ‖ Let $𝒜 = \powerset{A}$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $μ: 𝒜 → [0, +∞]$ such that $μ(A)$ is $0$ if $A = ∅$
    and $μ(A) = 1$ otherwise. ⦉

  ‖ Then $μ$ is not a measure, nor is $μ$ finitely additive. ⦉

  ‖ \begin{proof} ⦉

  ‖ Let $B, C ∈ 𝒜$, ⦉

  ‖ $B ∩ C = ∅$ ⦉

  ‖ then using finite additivity ⦉

  ‖ we obtain a contradiction ⦉

  ‖ $ ⦉

  ‖ 1 = μ(B ∪ C) = μ(B) + μ(C) = 2 ⦉

  ‖ $. ⦉
