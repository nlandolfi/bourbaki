\ssection{Why}

We want to extend addition to $\C$.

Let $z_1, z_2 \in \C$ with $z_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $z_2 = (x_2, y_2)$.
The \t{complex sum} of $z_1$ and $z_2$ is the complex number $(x_1+x_2,y_1+y_2)$.

\ssubsection{Notation}

For $z_1, z_2 \in \C$, we denote the complex sum of $z_1$ and $z_2$ by $z_1 + z_2$.
The notation is justified because the complex sum of two purely real complex numbers corresponds to the purely real complex numbers whose real part is the real sum of the real parts of the first two numbers.


Recall that we denote $z_1 = x_1 + iy_1$ and $z_2 = x_2 + iy_2$.
For example, we can express the definition of addition as
\[
	z_1 + z_2 = (x_1 + x_2) + i(y_1 + y_2)
\]
and multiplication is
