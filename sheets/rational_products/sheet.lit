§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $\eqc{(a, b)}, \eqc{(b, c)} ∈ 𝗤$. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬rational product❭ of $\eqc{(a, b)}$ with $\eqc{(b, c)}$
    is $\eqc{(ac , bd)}$.
    † ⦊
      ‖ An account that this is well-defined will appear in
        future editions. ⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the rational product of $q, r ∈ 𝗤$ by $q · r$. ⦉
