\ssection{Why}

We think there
is a functional
relationship
between elements of one set
and another set.

\ssection{Definition}

Let $\CU$ be a set
and $\CV$ be a set.
We have a data set
$(u^1, \dots, u^n)$
in $\CU$ and a data set
in $(v^1, \dots, v^n)$
in $\CV$.
We view $u^i$ as functionally
related to $v^i$.
We view these as pairs $(u^i,v^i)$
in $\CU \times \CV$ and speak
of
one data set
$((u^1, v^1), \dots, (u^n, v^n))$
in $\CU \times \CV$.
