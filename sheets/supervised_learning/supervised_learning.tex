\stitle{Supervised Learning}

\ssection{Why}

Often the problem of constructing an inductor is called supervised learning.
By supervision is meant that we have the postcepts which go along with the precepts.

\ssection{Definition}

Supervised learning is the task of constructing an inductor.
In this context, the postcepts are often called \t{labels}.
