\stitle{Relations}

\ssection{Why}

How can we relate
the elements of
two sets?

\ssection{Definition}

A
\definition{relation}{relation}
between two non-empty
\term{sets}{sets}
$A$ and $B$ is a subset of
$A \cross B$.
A relation on a single set
$C$ is a subset of $C \cross C$.

Let $a \in A$ and $b \in B$.
The pair $(a, b)$
may or may not be in a
relation on $A$
and $B$.
If $A \neq B$,
then $(b, a)$ is not
a member of the
product $A \cross B$,
and therefore not in
any relation on $A$ and $B$.
If $A = B$, however,
it may be that $(b, a)$
is in the relation.


\ssubsection{Notation}
Let $A$ and $B$ be nonempty sets
with $a \in A$ and $b \in B$.
Since relations are sets,
we can use upper case Latin letters.
Let $R$ be a relation on $A$ and $B$.
We denote that $(a, b) \in R$ by
$a R b$, read aloud as
\say{a in relation $R$ to b.}

When $A = B$, we tend to use
other symbols instead of letters.
For example,
$\sim$, $=$, $<$,
$\leq$, $\prec$, and $\preceq$.
