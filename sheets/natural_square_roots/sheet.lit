§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to solve equations with squares. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $m$ be a square number. ⦉

  ‖ We want to find $n$ to satisfy
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ n^2 = m. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ We call such an $n$ a ❬square root❭ of $m$. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ The square root of a square number is unique. ⦉
</statement>
¶ ⦊
  ‖ This result motivates definining a function the ❬square root
    function❭ which square numbers to their roots. ⦉
⦉

§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $S$ denote the set of square numbers. ($S ⊂ 𝗡)$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $f: S → N$ be the function such that $f(s)$ is the
    square root of $s$. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the result of $f$ on $n$ by $√{n}$. ⦉
