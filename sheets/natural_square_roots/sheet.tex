\section*{Why}

We want to solve equations with squares.

\section*{Definition}

Let $m$ be a square number.
We want to find $n$ to satisfy
\[
n^2 = m.
\]
We call such an $n$ a \t{square root} of $m$.

\begin{proposition}
The square root of a square number is unique.
\end{proposition}

This result motivates definining a function the \t{square root function} which square numbers to their roots.

\section*{Notation}

Let $S \subset \N  $ denote the set of square numbers.
Let $f: S \to N$ be the function such that $f(s)$ is the square root of $s$.
We denote the result of $f$ on $n$ by $\sqrt{n}$.
