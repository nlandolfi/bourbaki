\ssection{Why}

We want to solve equations
with squares.

\ssection{Definition}

Let $m$ be a square number.
We want to find $n$ to satisfy
\[
  n^2 = m.
\]
We call such an $n$ a
\ct{square root}{}
of $m$.

\begin{prop}
The square root of a square
number is unique.
\end{prop}

This result motivates
definining a function
the
\ct{square root function}{}
which square numbers
to their roots.

\ssection{Notation}

Let $S$ denote the set
of square numbers.
($S \subset \N)$.
Let $f: S \to N$ be
the function such that
$f(s)$ is the square root
of $s$.
each square number
with its root.
We denote
the result of $f$ on $n$
by $\sqrt{n}$.
