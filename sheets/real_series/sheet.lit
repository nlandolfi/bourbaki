§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to sum infinitely many real numbers. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(a_k)_{k ∈ 𝗡}$ be a sequence in $𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ Define $(s_n)_{n ∈ 𝗡}$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ s_n = ∑_{k = 1}^{n} a_k. ⦉
    ⦉

    ‖ We call $s_n$ the ❬$n$th partial sum❭ of $(x_k)$. ⦉

    ‖ In other words, the first partial sum $s_1$ is $a_1$, the
      second partial sum $s_2$ is $a_1 + a_2$, the third partial
      sum $s_3$ is $a_1 + a_2 + a_3$ and so on. ⦉⦉
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ We call $(s_n)$ the ❬sequence of partial sums❭ or ❬series❭
      of $(a_k)$. ⦉

    ‖ If the ❬series❭ converges, then we say that $(a_k)$ is
      ❬summable❭. ⦉

    ‖ Clearly not every series is summable: consider, for
      example, $a_k = 1$ for all $k$. It has the divergent
      series $(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, …)$. ⦉
  ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ If the sequence is summable, then there exists a unique $s
    ∈ 𝗥$ (the limit), which we denote
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ s = \lim_{n→∞} s_n = \lim_{n→∞} ∑_{k = 1}^{n} a_k. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ We read these relations aloud as “s is the limit as n
    goes to infinity of s n” and “s is the limit as n goes
    to infinity of the sum of a k from k equals 1 to n.” ⦉

  ‖ We often avoid referencing $s_n$ by abbreviating the above
    with
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ ∑_{k = 1}^{∞} a_k = s. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ We read this notation aloud as “the sum from 1 to infinity
    of a k is s.” ⦉

  ‖ The notation is subtle, and requires justification by the
    algebra of series.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will include such justification. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

§ Convergence ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ For a series to converge, intuition suggests that the
    additional terms added should be getting smaller and smaller.
    Indeed: ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Let $(a_k)_{k ∈ 𝗡}$ be a sequence of real numbers. ⦉

  ‖ If $(a_k)$ is summable then $a_k$ converges to $0$.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will include an account. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
</statement>
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The converse of this theorem has immediate relevance as a
    preliminary test for determining whether a series converges. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ If $(a_k)$ does not converge or converges to $a_0 ≠ 0$,
    then it is not summable. ⦉
</statement>
