\ssection{Why}

We want to sum infinitely
many real numbers.

\ssection{Definition}


Let $n$ be a natural number.
The $n$th \t{partial sum} of a sequence of real numbers is the sum of first $n$ elements of the sequence.
The first partial sum is the first term of the sequence.
The third partial sum is the sum of first three elements of the sequence.

The \t{series} of the sequence is the sequence of partial sums.
The sequence is \t{summable} if the series converges.

Since there exist sequences which do not converge, there exist sequences which are not summable.
Consider the sequence which alternates between $+1$ and $-1$, and starts with $+1$.
Its series alternates between $+1$ and $0$, and so does not converge.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $\seq{a}$ be a sequence of real numnbers.
For natural number $n$, define:
\[
  s_n = \sum_{k = 1}^{n} a_k.
\]
Then $\seq{s}$ is the series
of $\seq{a}$. If the series
converges, then there exists
a real number $s$, the limit,
and we write:
\[
  s = \lim_{n\to\infty} s_n = \lim_{n\to\infty} \sum_{k = 1}^{n} a_k
\]
We read these relations aloud as
\say{s is the limit as n goes to infinity
of s n} and
\say{s is the limit as n goes to infinity
of the sum of a k from k equals 1 to n.}

To avoid referencing $s_n$, we write:
\[
  \sum_{k = 1}^{\infty} a_k = s,
\]
read aloud as the
\say{the sum from 1 to infinity
of a k is s.}
The notation is subtle, and
requires justification
by the algebra of series.\footnote{Future editions will include such justification.}
