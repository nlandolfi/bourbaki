§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want fractions.

§ Rational equivalence ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Consider $𝗭 ×(𝗭 - \set{0_{𝗭}})$. ⦉

  ‖ We say that the elements $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$ of this
    set are ❬rational equivalent❭ if $ad = bc$. ⦉

  ‖ Brieﬂy, the intuition is that $(a, b)$ represents $a$ over
    $b$ ⦉

  ‖ In the usual notation, $(a, b)$ represents “$a/b$”. ⦉

  ‖ So this equivalence relation says these two are the same if
    $a/b = c/d$ or else $ad= bc$. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Rational equivalence is an equivalence relation on $𝗭 ×(𝗭 -
    \set{0_{𝗭}})$.

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬set of rational numbers❭ is the set of equivalence
    classes (see␣
    <a href='/sheets/equivalence_classes.html'>
      ‖ Equivalence Classes ⦉
    </a>
    ) of $𝗭 ×(𝗭 - \set{0_{𝗭}})$ under ratioanl equivalence. ⦉

  ‖ We call an element of the set of rational numbers a
    ❬rational number❭ or ❬rational❭. ⦉

  ‖ We call the set of rational numbers the ❬set of rationals❭
    or ❬rationals❭ for short. ⦉
⦉

§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the set of rationals by $𝗤$.
    † ⦊
      ‖ From what we can tell, $𝗤$ is a mnemonic for “quantity”,
        from the latin “quantitas.” ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ If we denote rational equivalence by $∼$ then $𝗤 = (𝗭 ×(𝗭
    - \set{0_{𝗭}}))/∼$. ⦉
