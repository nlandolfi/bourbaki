§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We are constantly thinking of the integers as the endpoints
    of equal length segments of a line. ⦉
⦉

§ Discussion ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We commonly associate elements of the integers with the
    endpoints of equal-length segments of a real line. ⦉

  ‖ Take segment $S_0$ of $L$ with endpoints $p$ and $q$. ⦉

  ‖ Associate the point $p$ with $0$. ⦉

  ‖ Associate the point $q$ with $1$. ⦉

  ‖ Take a segment $S_1$ of equal length, non-overlapping with
    $S_0$, who shares the endpoint $q$. ⦉

  ‖ Associate the second endpoint of this segment $2$. ⦉

  ‖ Continue with the rest. ⦉

  ‖ We call the line so formed the ❬integral line❭ of unit
    $S_0$. ⦉

§ Integral Distance ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $f: 𝗭 → 𝗭$ be defined by $f(a, b) = a - b$ if $a
    > b$ and $f(a, b) = b - a$ if $b > a$. ⦉

  ‖ Notice that $f$ is symmetric: $f(a,b) = f(b, a)$. ⦉

  ‖ The (geometric) interpretation of $f$ is the distance between
    the points associated with the two integers $a, b ∈ 𝗭$ in
    some integral line. ⦉

  ‖ We call $f$ the ❬integral distance❭. ⦉

  ‖ Notice that $f(a, b) > 0$ for all $a, b ∈ 𝗭$. ⦉
⦉

§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the distance between $a, b ∈ 𝗭$ by $\abs{a -
    b}$. ⦉
