§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The set of real numbers is large, and so we can often
    embed other sets within it. ⦉

  ‖ Also, we are often interested in modelling random quantities. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬real outcome variable❭ (or ❬real random variable❭, ❬random
    variable❭) is an outcome variable whose codomain is a subset
    of the real numbers. ⦉

  ‖ Such variables are often called ❬quantitative❭. ⦉

  ‖ Caution: many authorities ‹reserve› the term ‹random variable›
    for outcome variables whose domain is $𝗥$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬probability mass function❭ (or ❬p.m.f.❭, ❬pmf❭) of a
    random variable $X: Ω → 𝗥$ is the function $f: 𝗥 → 𝗥$
    defined by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ f(x) = P(X = x) ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ If $Ω$ is finite, then $\range X$ is a finite set, and so
    the probability mass function is the extension to $𝗥$ of the
    induced distribution $p: \range(X) → 𝗥$ of $X$. ⦉

  ‖ If $\range(X)$ is finite or countable, we call $X$ a
    ❬discrete random variable❭. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ For a real-valued random variable $X: Ω → 𝗥$ and $α ∈ 𝗥$,
    we often abbreviate the sets
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \Set{ω ∈ Ω}{X(ω) ≤ α} \text{ and } \Set{ω ∈ Ω}{X(ω) ≥
        α} ⦉
    ⦉
    by $\set{X ≤ α}$ and $\set{X ≥ α}$ respectively. ⦉

  ‖ Also, given a probability measure $P$, we denote the
    probabilities of these events by $P(X ≤ α)$ and $P(X ≥ α)$,
    respectively. ⦉

  ‖ Similar to before, the notation $X ∼ f$ is shorthand for
    the random variable $X: Ω → 𝗥$ has probability mass function
    $f: 𝗥 → 𝗥$. ⦉
⦉

§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ ‹Tossing a fair coin $n$ times›. ⦉

  ‖ Suppose we model $n$ tosses of a fair coin as usual, so
    that $Ω = \set{0,1}^n$ and $p: Ω → 𝗥$ is defined by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ p(ω) = 2^{-n} \quad \text{for all } ω ∈ Ω ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Recall that we have calculuated $P(X = k)$ to be ${n
    \choose k} 2^{-n}$. ⦉

  ‖ Thus, the probability mass function $f: 𝗥 → 𝗥$ of $X$
    satisifes
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ f(k) = {n \choose k} 2^{-n} \quad \text{for } k = 0,
        …, n ⦉
    ⦉
    and $f(x) = 0$ for $x ≠ 0, …, n$. ⦉
⦉

§ Cumulative distribution function ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given a random variable $X: Ω → 𝗥$ and probability measure
    $P$ on $\pow{Ω}$, the function $F: 𝗥 → 𝗥$ defined by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ F(x) = P(X ≤ x) ⦉
    ⦉
    is called the ❬cumulative distribution function❭ of $X$. ⦉
