§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ When is a linear transformation between $V$ and $W$
    one-to-one? ⦉

  ‖ In other words, when does
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ Tx = Ty ⇒ x = y ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Rearranging, and using additivity, we ask when
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ T(x - y) = 0 ⇒ x - y = 0 ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Clearly we are interested in vectors $z$ for which $Tz =
    0$. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $T ∈ ℒ(V, W)$. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬null space❭ (or ❬kernel❭) of $T$ is the set of
    vectors in $V$ which are mapped to $0$ under $T$. ⦉

  ‖ In symbols, the null space of $T$ is the set
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \null T = \Set{v ∈ V}{Tv = 0} ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ The word “null” means “zero” in German. ⦉
⦉

§§ A subspace ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Why use the term ‹space›? ⦉

  ‖ Well, $\null T$ is a ‹subspace› of $V$. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Suppose $T ∈ ℒ(V, W)$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $\null(T)$ is a subspace of $V$. ⦉
</statement>
<proof>
  ‖ We verify that $\null(T)$ contains $0$ and is closed under
    vector addition and scalar multiplication. ⦉

  ‖ First, $0 ∈ \null T$ since $T0 = 0$ by homogeneity. ⦉

  ‖ Second, by additivity, if $x, y ∈ \null T$, then
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ T(x + y) = Tx + Ty = 0 + 0 = 0 ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Third, if $u ∈ \null T$ and $α ∈ 𝗙$, then
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ T(λu) = λ(Tu) = λ0 = 0 ⦉
    ⦉⦉
</proof>

§§ Characterization of injectivity ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Suppose $T ∈ ℒ(V, W)$. ⦉

  ‖ Then
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \null T = \set{0} \iff T \text{ is one-to-one} ⦉
    ⦉⦉
</statement>
¶ ⦊
  ‖ If $\null T = \set{0}$ we say that $T$ has ❬zero
    nullspace❭ or ❬trivial nullspace❭. ⦉
⦉

§§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ ‹Zero map.›

    ‖ Suppose $T$ is the zero map from $V$ to $W$. ⦉

    ‖ In other words,
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ Tv = 0 \quad \text{for all } v ∈ V ⦉
      ⦉⦉⦉

  ‖ Then $\null T = V$. ⦉

  ‖ I.e., the null space is the whole space. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ ‹Simple function on $𝗖^3$.› ⦉

  ‖ Define $φ ∈ ℒ(𝗖^3, 𝗖)$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ φ(z_1, z_2, z_3) = z_1 + 2z_2 + 3z_3 ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Then $\null φ$ is
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \Set{(z_1,z_2,z_3) ∈ 𝗖^3}{z_1 + 2z_2 + 3z_3 = 0} ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ This is the ‹solution set› of a linear equation. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ ‹Polynomial differentiation.› ⦉

  ‖ Suppose $D ∈ ℒ(𝒫(𝗥), 𝒫(𝗥))$ is the linear map defined by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ Dp = p' \quad \text{for all } p ∈ 𝒫(𝗥) ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ In other words, $Dp$ is the derivative of the polynomial
    $p$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $\null(D)$ is the set of constant functions. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ ‹Multiplication by $x^2$.› ⦉

  ‖ Define $T ∈ ℒ(𝒫(𝗥), 𝒫(𝗥))$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ (Tp)(x) = x^2p(x) \quad \text{for all } x ∈ 𝗥 \text{
        and } p ∈ 𝒫(𝗥) ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Then $\null(T) = \set{0}$, since no other polynomial
    satisfies $x^2p(x) = 0$ for all $x ∈ 𝗥$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ ‹Backward shift.› ⦉

  ‖ Define $T ∈ ℒ(𝗙^𝗡, 𝗙^𝗡)$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ T(x_1, x_2, x_3, …, ) = (x_2, x_3, …, ) ⦉
    ⦉
    so that $T$ is the backward shift ⦉

  ‖ Then $T(x_1, x_2, x_3, …) = 0$ if and only $x_2 = x_3 =
    ⋯ = 0$. ⦉

  ‖ So
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \null T = \Set{(α, 0, 0, …,)}{α ∈ 𝗙} ⦉
