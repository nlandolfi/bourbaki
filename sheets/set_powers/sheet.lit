§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to consider all the subsets of a given set. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We do not yet have a principle stating that such a set
    exists, but our intuition suggests that it does. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='principle' text='powers'>
  ‖ For every set, there exists a set of its subsets. ⦉
</statement>
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We call the existence of this set the ❬principle of powers❭
    and we call the set the ❬power set❭.
    † ⦊
      ‖ This terminology is standard, but unfortunate. Future
        editions may change these terms. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ As usual, the principle of extension gives uniqueness (see␣
    <a href='/sheets/set_equality.html'>
      ‖ Set Equality ⦉
    </a>
    ). ⦉

  ‖ The power set of a set includes the set itself and the
    empty set. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A$ denote a set. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the power set of $A$ by $\powerset{A}$, read
    aloud as “powerset of A.” ⦉

  ‖ $A ∈ \powerset{A}$ and $∅ ∈ \powerset{A}$. ⦉

  ‖ However, $A ⊂ \powerset{A}$ is false. ⦉
⦉

§§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $a, b, c$ denote distinct objects. Let $A = \set{a, b
    ,c}$ ⦉

  ‖ and $B = \set{a, b}$. Then ⦉

  ‖ $B ⊂ A$. ⦉

  ‖ In other notation, ⦉

  ‖ $B ∈ \powerset{A}$. ⦉

  ‖ Showing each of the following is straightforward. ⦉
  𝍫 ⦊
    ‣ The empty set: $\powerset{∅} = \set{∅}$ ⦉

    ‣ Singletons: $\powerset{\set{a}} = \set{∅, \set{a}}$ ⦉

    ‣ Pairs: $\powerset{\set{a, b}} = \set{∅, \set{a}, \set{b},
      \set{a, b}}$ ⦉

    ‣ Triples:
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ \powerset{\set{a, b, c}} = ⦉

        ‖ \{ ⦉

        ‖ ∅, ⦉

        ‖ \set{a}, ⦉

        ‖ \set{b}, ⦉

        ‖ \set{c}, ⦉

        ‖ \set{a, b}, ⦉

        ‖ \set{b, c}, ⦉

        ‖ \set{a, c}, ⦉

        ‖ \set{a, b, c} ⦉

        ‖ \} ⦉
      ⦉⦉

⦉

§ Properties ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We can guess the following easy properties.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will expand this account. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ $∅ ∈ \powerset{A}$ ⦉
</statement>
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ $A ∈ \powerset{A}$ ⦉
</statement>
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We call $A$ and $∅$ the ❬improper❭ subsets of $A$. ⦉

  ‖ All other subsets we call ❬proper❭. ⦉
⦉

§ Basic fact ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ $E ⊂ F ⟹ \powerset{E} ⊂ \powerset{F}$ ⦉
