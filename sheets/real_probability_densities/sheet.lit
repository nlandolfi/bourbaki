§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to talk about probability on the set of outcomes
    which is the real numbers. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬probability density❭ or ❬probability density function❭ is
    a real-valued function on the reals which is nonnegative and
    normalized. ⦉

  ‖ A real-valued function on the reals is ❬normalized❭ if it
    integrates to 1. ⦉
⦉

<!-- TODO how to interact with measurability -->

§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $f: 𝗥 → 𝗥$ with $f ≥ 0$ and $∫f = 1$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $f$ is a probability density. ⦉
