\section*{Why}

We want to talk about probability on the set of outcomes which is the real numbers.

\section*{Definition}

A \t{probability density} or \t{probability density function} is a real-valued function on the reals which is nonnegative and normalized.
A real-valued function on the reals is \t{normalized} if it integrates to 1.

\section*{Notation}

Let $f: \R  \to \R $ with $f \geq 0$ and $\int f = 1$.
Then $f$ is a probability density.
