  ‖ Linear equations are ubiquitous. ⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given $a ∈ 𝗥^n$ and $y ∈ 𝗥$, suppose we want to find $x
    ∈ 𝗥^n$ satisfying

      ‖ a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + ⋯ + a_nx_n = y. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ We refer to this expression as a ❬real linear equation❭ or
    ❬linear equation❭. ⦉

  ‖ We treat each component $x_i ∈ 𝗥$ as a variable and we
    treat each component $a_i ∈ 𝗥$ and $y ∈ 𝗥$ as constants. ⦉

  ‖ We call the pair $(a, y)$ the ❬real linear equation
    constants❭.

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The source of the terminology “linear} is by viewing the
    left hand side as a function. ⦉

  ‖ Define $f: 𝗥^n → 𝗥$ by $f(x) = ∑_{i}a_ix_i$. ⦉

  ‖ We want to find $x ∈ 𝗥^n$ to satisfy $f(x) = b$. ⦉

  ‖ Notice that $f$ is a ‹linear› real function.

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Moreover, to each linear function $f: 𝗥^d → 𝗥$ there exists
    a vector $a ∈ 𝗥^d$ so that $f(x) = ∑_{i} a_ix_i$. ⦉

  ‖ For this reason, if we are given several linear function
    $f_1, …, f_m$, then we can think of these as several
    vectors $a^1, …, a^n$. ⦉

  ‖ If we are also given $b_i ∈ 𝗥$ for each $i = 1, …, m$,
    then we have the vector $b ∈ 𝗥^m$ ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We can define the two-dimensional array $A ∈ 𝗥^{m × n}$ by
    $A_{ij} = a^{i}_j$. ⦉

  ‖ For this reason, a ❬linear system of equations❭ is a pair
    $(A, b)$. ⦉

  ‖ A solution of a linear system of equations is a vector $x
    ∈ 𝗥^n$ satisfying the equations
