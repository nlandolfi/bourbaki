  ‖ We explore matrix-vector multiplication. ⦉

  ‖ \ssection{Definition} ⦉

  ‖ Given a matrix $A ∈ 𝗥^{m × n}$ and a vector $x ∈ 𝗥^{n}$,
    the ❬product❭ of $A$ ❬with❭ $x$ is the vector $y ∈ 𝗥^{m}$
    defined by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ y_i = ∑_{j = 1}^{n} A_{ij} x_j, \quad i = 1, …, m. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ \ssubsection{Notation} ⦉

  ‖ We denote the product of $A$ with $x$ by $Ax$. ⦉

  ‖ With which we concisely write the system linear equations
    $(A, b)$ as $b = Ax$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ This notation suggests both algebraic and geometric
    interpretations of solving systems of linear equations. ⦉

  ‖ The algebraic interpretation is that we are interested in
    the invertibility of the function $x \mapsto Ax$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, we are interested in the existence of an
    inverse element of $A$. ⦉

  ‖ The geometric interpretation is that $A$ transforms the
    vector $x$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Conversely, we can view $x$ as transforming (acting on) $A$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $a^j ∈ 𝗥^m$ denote the $j$th column of $A$, then
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ Ax = ∑_{j = 1}^{n} x_j a^j. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ In other words, $y$ is linear combination of the columns of
    $A$. ⦉
⦉

  ‖ \ssection{Properties} ⦉

  ‖ We call the function $f: 𝗥^n → 𝗥^m$ defined by $f(x) =
    Ax$ the ❬matrix multiplication function❭ (or ❬matrix-vector
    product function❭) associated with $A$. ⦉

  ‖ $f$ is satisfies the following two important properties:
    𝍫 ⦊
      ‣ $A(x + y) = Ax + Ay$ ⦉

      ‣ $A(\alpha x) = \alpha Ax$. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ We call such a function $f$ ❬linear❭. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, the matrix multiplication function is linear. ⦉

  ‖ Conversely, if $g: 𝗥^n → 𝗥^m$ is linear, there exists a
    matrix inducing $g$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ \begin{proposition} ⦉

  ‖ Let $f: 𝗥^n → 𝗥^m$ be linear. ⦉

  ‖ Then there exists a unique $A ∈ 𝗥^{m × n}$ satisfying
    $f(x) = Ax$ for all $x ∈ 𝗥^n$. ⦉

  ‖ \end{proposition} ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ \begin{proof} ⦉

  ‖ Evaluate $f$ at the standard unit vectors $e_i$. ⦉

  ‖ The $i$th component of $e_i$ is 1 and all other components
    are 0. ⦉

  ‖ \end{proof} ⦉
