\stitle{Partial Orders}

\ssection{Why}

We want to handle elements of a
set in a particular order.

\ssection{Definition}

Let $R$ be a relation on a non-empty set $A$.
$R$ is a \ct{partial order}{partialorder} if it is
\rt{reflexive}{reflexive}, \rt{transitive}{transitive},
and \rt{anti-symmetric}{anti-symmetric}.
If $(a, b) \in R$ we say that
$a$ \ct{precedes}{} $b$ and
that $b$ \ct{succeeds}{} $a$.

A \ct{partially ordered set}{partiallyorderedset} is a set
and a partial order.
The language partial is meant to suggest that two elements
need not be comparable.
For example, suppose $R$ is $\Set{(a,a)}{a \in A}$;
we may justifiably call this no order at all and
call $A$ totally unordered, but it is a partial order
by our definition.

\ssubsection{Notation}
We denote a partial order on a set $A$ by $\preceq$.
We read $\preceq$ aloud as \say{precedes or equal to} and so read $a\preceq b$ aloud as \say{a precedes or is equal to b.}
If $a \preceq b$ but $a \neq b$, we write $a \prec b$, read aloud as \say{a precedes b.}
