\section*{Why}

We want to count in circles.\footnote{Future editions will expand.}

\section*{Definition}

Let $n \in \Z $ with $n > 1$ and take $a, b \in \Z $.
The integers $a$ and $b$ are \t{congruent modulo} $n$ (or with respect to the \t{modulus} $n$) if $n$ is a divisor of their difference.\footnote{Future editions will expand, and may need a sheet on congruence relations.}
