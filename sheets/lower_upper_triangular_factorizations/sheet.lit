§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ If a system $(A, b)$ is ordinarily reducible, then there
    exists $L$ unit lower triangular and $U$ upper triangular so
    that $A = LU$. ⦉

  ‖ When does such a factorization exist? ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A ∈ 𝗥^{m ×m}$. ⦉

  ‖ A ❬lower upper triangular factorization❭ of $A$ is a pair
    of matrices $(L ∈ 𝗥^{m ×m}, U ∈ 𝗥^{m ×m})$ where $L$ is
    unit lower triangular, $U$ is upper triangular and $A = LU$. ⦉

  ‖ Other terminology includes ❬lower upper triangular
    decomposition❭, ❬LU factorization❭, and ❬LU decomposition❭. ⦉

<statement id='proposition:lower_upper_triangular_factorizations:ordinary' type='proposition'>
  ‖ If $(A, b)$ is ordinarily reducible, a $LU$ factorization
    exists. ⦉
</statement>
¶ ⦊
  ‖ What about an $LU$-factorization when $(A, b)$ is not
    ordinarily reducible? ⦉

  ‖ The main issue is that we may encounter a diagonal entry
    of some reduction of $A$ which is zero. ⦉

 A \t{LDU factorization} of a $n \times n$ positive definite matrix permuted by $\upto{n}$ is an ordered pair whose first coordinate is a unit lower triangular matrix and whose second coordinate is a positive diagonal matrix, with the property that the given matrix permuted according to the permutation is equal to the product of the unit lower triangular matrix, the diagonal matrix, and the transpose of the unit lower triangular matrix.

 \ssection{Notation}

 Let $(L, D)$ be an LDU factorization of $A \in \SymPDMat{n}$ permuted by the permutation $\sigma: \upto{n} \to \upto{n}$. Then
 $$
   \IdxMat{\sigma}A\IdxMat{\sigma}^{\tp}
   =
   LDL^{\tp}.
 $$
 Alternatively,
 $$
   A = \IdxMat{\sigma}^\tp L D L^{\tp} \IdxMat{\sigma}.
 $$

 \ssection{Existence}

 \begin{prop}
   For every positive definite matrix $A \in \SymPDMat{n}$ and permutation $\sigma: \upto{n} \to \upto{n}$ there exists a unique LDU factorization of $A$ permuted by $\sigma$.
 \end{prop}
