§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬subspace❭ of a vector space is a subset of vectors that
    is a vector space when restriction vector addition and scalar
    multiplication to the set. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, a subspace is a subset of a vector space
    which is closed under vector addition and scalar
    multiplication. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ For example, the entire set of vectors is a subspace. ⦉

  ‖ As a second example, the set consisting only of the zero
    vector is a subspace; we call this the ❬zero subspace❭. ⦉

  ‖ These two subspaces are the ❬trivial subspaces❭. ⦉

  ‖ A ❬nontrivial subspace❭ is a subspace that is not trivial. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(V, \F)$ be a vector space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $U ⊂ V$ with
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ α u + β v ∈ U ⦉
    ⦉
    for all $α, β ∈ \F$ and $u, v ∈ U$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $U$ is a subspace of $(V, 𝗙)$. ⦉
⦉

§ Properties ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ \begin{proposition} ⦉

  ‖ The intersection of a family of subspaces is a subspace. ⦉

  ‖ \end{proposition} ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ \begin{proposition} ⦉

  ‖ There exists a family of subspaces whose union is not a
    subspace; ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ \begin{remark} ⦉

  ‖ In other words: the union of a family subspaces need not
    be a subspace. ⦉

  ‖ \end{remark} ⦉

  ‖ \end{proposition} ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ \begin{proposition} ⦉

  ‖ A subspace must contain the zero vector; in other words,
    every subspace is nonempty. ⦉

  ‖ \end{proposition} ⦉
