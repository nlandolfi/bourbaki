§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ An integral is a limit. ⦉

  ‖ When can we exchange this limit with another? ⦉

  ‖ We give a first result in the search for sufficient
    conditions to do so. ⦉
⦉

§ Result ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ When context is clear, we refer to the following proposition
    as the ❬monotone convergence theorem❭. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ The integral ⦉

    ‖ of the almost everywhere limit ⦉

    ‖ of an almost-everywhere nondecreasing sequence ⦉

    ‖ of measurable, nonnegative, ⦉

    ‖ extended-real-valued ⦉

    ‖ functions is the ⦉

    ‖ limit of the sequence ⦉

    ‖ of integrals of the functions. ⦉
  ⦉

  <proof>
    ¶ ⦊
      ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ be a measure space, and let $\seqt{f}:
        → \eri$ a $𝒜$-measurable function for every natural number
        $n$ and let $f: X → \eri$ a $𝒜$-measurable function. ⦉

      ‖ We want to show that if
        ◇ ⦊
          ‖ f_n(x) ≤ f_{n+1}(x) ⦉

          ‖ \quad ⦉

          ‖ \text{ and } ⦉

          ‖ \quad ⦉

          ‖ f(x) = \lim_n \seqt{f}(x) ⦉
        ⦉
        hold for all natural $n$ and almost every $x$ in $X$,
        then
        ◇ ⦊
          ‖ ∫f dμ = \lim_n ∫f_n dμ. ⦉
