§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ An integral is a limit. ⦉

  ‖ When can we exchange this limit with another? ⦉

  ‖ We being a development culminating in a sufficient condition
    for exchange. ⦉
⦉

§ Result ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The integral of the almost everywhere limit of an
    almost-everywhere nondecreasing sequence of measurable,
    nonnegative, extended-real-valued functions is the limit of the
    sequence of integrals of the functions. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Suppose $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ is a measure space, $\seqt{f}: X →
    \eri$ is a $𝒜$-measurable function for every natural number
    $n$ and $f: X → \eri$ is a $𝒜$-measurable function. ⦉

  ‖ If
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ f_n(x) ≤ f_{n+1}(x) ⦉

      ‖ \quad ⦉

      ‖ \text{ and } ⦉

      ‖ \quad ⦉

      ‖ f(x) = \lim_n \seqt{f}(x) ⦉
    ⦉
    hold for all natural $n$ and almost every $x$ in $X$, then
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ ∫f dμ = \lim_n ∫f_n dμ. ⦉
