\section*{Why}

An integral is a limit.
When can we exchange this limit with another?
We give a first result in the search for sufficient conditions to do so.

\section*{Result}

When context is clear, we refer to the following proposition as the \t{monotone convergence theorem}.

\begin{proposition}
The integral
of the almost everywhere limit
of an almost-everywhere nondecreasing sequence
of measurable, nonnegative,
extended-real-valued
functions is the
limit of the sequence
of integrals of the functions.

\begin{proof}Let $(X, \mathcal{A} , \mu )$ be a measure space, and let $\seqt{f}: \to \eri$ a $\mathcal{A} $-measurable function for every natural number $n$ and let $f: X \to \eri$ a $\mathcal{A} $-measurable function.
We want to show that if
\[
f_n(x) \leq f_{n+1}(x)
\quad
\text{ and }
\quad
f(x) = \lim_n \seqt{f}(x)
\]
hold for all natural $n$ and almost every $x$ in $X$, then
\[
\int f d\mu  = \lim_n \int f_n d\mu .
\]
\end{proof}
\end{proposition}
