\ssection{Why}

Often the precepts and postcepts are elements of $d$-dimensional and $m$-dimensional
space, respectively.
Moreover, we often believe in the existence
of a functional prelation between these
two spaces.

\ssection{Definition}

We think a vector in
$d$-dimensional space
and a vector in $m$-dimensional
space are approximately related
by a function.
We call the argument to the
function the \t{independent variable}
and we call the result
of the function the \t{dependent variable}.
If $m = 1$, the dependent variable
is a single real number.
