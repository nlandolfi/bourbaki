\ssection{Why}

We think there
is a functional
relationship
between vectors in $d$-dimensional
space and vectors
in $m$-dimensional space.

\ssection{Definition}

We think a vector in
$d$-dimensional space
and a vector in $m$-dimensional
space are approximately related
by a function.
We call the argument to the
function the \ct{independent variable}{}
and we call the result
of the function the \ct{dependent variable}{}.
If $m = 1$, the dependent variable
is a single real number.

A \ct{predictor}{} is a function
from the $d$ dimensional space
to the $m$ dimensional space.
