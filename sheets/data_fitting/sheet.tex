\ssection{Why}

We think there
is a functional
relationship
between vectors in $n$
dimensional space and vectors
in $m$ dimensional space.

\ssection{Definition}

We think a vector in
$d$ dimensional space
and a vector in $m$ dimensional
space are approximately related
by a function.
We call the argument to the
function the \ct{independent variable}{}
and we call the result
of the function the \ct{dependent variable}{}.
Very often $m = 1$ so the dependent
variable is a scalar.

A \ct{predictor}{} is a function
from the $d$ dimensional space
to the $m$ dimensional space.
