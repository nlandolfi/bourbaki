§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We generalize the algebraic structure of addition and
    multiplication over the integers.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will likely modify this sheet, and give
        a genetic treatment involving the solution of polynomial
        equations by Galois. ⦉

⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬ring❭ (or ❬ring with identity❭) $(A, f, g)$ is a set
    $A$ and two operations on $A$ satisfying the following set
    of conditions. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ (A) ⦉

  ‖ (i) $f$ is associative. ⦉

  ‖ (ii) $f$ is ‹commutative›, ⦉

  ‖ (iii) $A$ has an identity for $f$ (i.e., is $e ∈ A$ with
    $f(a, e) = f(e, a) = a$ for all $a ∈ A$ ⦉

  ‖ (iv) $A$ has inverse elements for $f$ (i.e., for any $a ∈
    A$, there is $\tilde{a} $ satisfying $f(a,\tilde{a}) =
    f(\tilde{a}, b) = e$) ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ (B) ⦉

  ‖ (i) $g$ is associative; ⦉

  ‖ (ii) $A$ has an identity element for $g$ (i.e., there is
    $\tilde{e} ∈ A$ satisfying $g(a, \tilde{e}) = g(\tilde{e},a) =
    a$) ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ (C) ⦉

  ‖ (i) $g$ left distributes: $g(f(a, b), c) = f(g(a,c), g(b,c)$; ⦉

  ‖ (ii) $g$ right distributes: $g(c,f(a,b)) = f(g(c,a), g(c,b))$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Conditions (A) concern $f$, conditions (B) concern $g$, and
    conditions (C) relate the two. ⦉

  ‖ Define $ψ: 𝗭 × 𝗭 → 𝗭$ by $ψ(a, b) = a+b$ and $π: 𝗭 ×
    𝗭 → 𝗭$ by $\pi(a, b) = a·b$. ⦉

  ‖ We have defined a ring so that $(𝗭, ψ, π)$ is one. ⦉

  ‖ The element referred to in (A.2) is $0 ∈ 𝗭$, so we refer
    to this element in any ring as the ❬additive identity❭. ⦉

  ‖ That referred to (A.3) is $1 ∈ 𝗭$, so we refer to this
    element in any ring as the ❬multiplicative identity❭. ⦉

  ‖ We refer to the elements mentioned in (A.4) as ❬additive
    inverses❭. ⦉

  ‖ We call to $f$ ❬ring addition❭ and $g$ ❬ring multiplication❭. ⦉

  ‖ Although integer products are commutative, we have not
    required this aspect (future editions will elaborate). ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The notation commonly adopted in discussing rings relies on
    analogy with the set of integers $𝗭$. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the ring addition by $+$ and ring multiplication
    by $·$. ⦉

  ‖ Moreover, we denote the ring’s additive identity by $0$ and
    the ring’s multiplicative identity by $1$. ⦉

  ‖ Finally, we denote the additive inverse of $a ∈ A$ by $-a$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Rewriting the conditions (A), (B), (C) in this notation
    gives familiar-looking relations, from when the objects
    involved were integers. ⦉

  ‖ (A) (1) $a+(b + c) = (a+b)+c$; (2) $a+b = b+a$; (3) $a +
    0 = 0 + a = a$; (4) $a + (-a) = 0$. ⦉

  ‖ (B) (1) $a(bc) = (ab)c$; (2) $1a = a1 = a$. ⦉

  ‖ (C) (1) $(a+b)c = ac + bc$; (2) $c(a+b) = ca + cb$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Immediate consequences ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We need not require that $0x = 0$, because we can deduce
    it:
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ 0x + x = (0 + 1)x = 1x = x. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Similarly, $(-a)b = -(ab)$ since
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ ab + (-a)b = (a + (-a))b = 0b = 0. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Other familiar relations among the integers, e.g. $(-a)(-b) =
    ab$, may be deduced. ⦉
