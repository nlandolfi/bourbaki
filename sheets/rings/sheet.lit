§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We generalize the algebraic structure of ‹addition› and
    ‹multiplication› over the integers.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will likely modify this sheet, and give
        a genetic treatment involving the solution of polynomial
        equations by Galois. ⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬ring❭ (or ❬ring with identity❭) $(R, f, g)$ is a set
    $A$ and two binary operations on $R$ satisfying the following
    set of conditions. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ (A) ⦉

  ‖ (i) $f$ is associative. ⦉

  ‖ (ii) $f$ is ‹commutative›, ⦉

  ‖ (iii) $A$ has an identity for $f$ (i.e., is $e ∈ R$ with
    $f(r, e) = f(e, r) = r$ for all $r ∈ R$ ⦉

  ‖ (iv) $R$ has inverse elements for $f$ (i.e., for any $r ∈
    R$, there is $\tilde{r} $ satisfying $f(r,\tilde{r}) =
    f(\tilde{r}, r) = e$) ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ (B) ⦉

  ‖ (i) $g$ is associative; ⦉

  ‖ (ii) $R$ has an identity element for $g$ (i.e., for any $r
    ∈ R$, there is $\tilde{e} ∈ A$ satisfying $g(r, \tilde{e}) =
    g(\tilde{e},r) = r$) ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ (C) ⦉

  ‖ (i) $g$ left distributes:
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ g(f(x, y), α) = f(g(α,x), g(α,y)) \quad \text{for all }
        x, y, α ∈ R ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ (ii) $g$ right distributes:
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ g(α, f(x,y)) = f(g(α,x), g(α,y)) \quad \text{for all }
        x, y, α ∈ R ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Conditions (A) concern $f$, conditions (B) concern $g$, and
    conditions (C) relate the two. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Clearly, $𝗭$ with addition and multiplication is a ring. ⦉

  ‖ The element referred to in (A.2) is $0 ∈ 𝗭$, so we refer
    to this element in any ring as the ❬additive identity❭. ⦉

  ‖ That referred to (A.3) is $1 ∈ 𝗭$, so we refer to this
    element in any ring as the ❬multiplicative identity❭. ⦉

  ‖ We refer to the elements mentioned in (A.4) as ❬additive
    inverses❭. ⦉

  ‖ We call to $f$ ❬ring addition❭ and $g$ ❬ring multiplication❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  <!--
 <div data-littype='run'> Although integer products are commutative, we have not
    required this aspect (future editions will elaborate). </div>
    -->

  ‖ A ring which for which multiplication is commutative is
    called a ❬commutative ring❭. ⦉

  ‖ Note that a ring is ‹always› commutative with respect to
    addition, here the term commutative refers to multiplication. ⦉

  ‖ A ring for which there are inverse elements, excepting 0,
    is called a ❬division ring❭). ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The notation commonly adopted in discussing rings relies on
    analogy with the set of integers $𝗭$. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the ring addition by $+$ and ring multiplication
    by $·$. ⦉

  ‖ Moreover, we denote the ring’s additive identity by $0$ and
    the ring’s multiplicative identity by $1$. ⦉

  ‖ Finally, we denote the additive inverse of $a ∈ A$ by $-a$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Rewriting the conditions (A), (B), (C) in this notation
    gives familiar-looking relations, from when the objects
    involved were integers. ⦉

  ‖ (A) (1) $a+(b + c) = (a+b)+c$; (2) $a+b = b+a$; (3) $a +
    0 = 0 + a = a$; (4) $a + (-a) = 0$. ⦉

  ‖ (B) (1) $a(bc) = (ab)c$; (2) $1a = a1 = a$. ⦉

  ‖ (C) (1) $(a+b)c = ac + bc$; (2) $c(a+b) = ca + cb$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Immediate consequences ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We need not require that $0x = 0$, because we can deduce
    it:
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ 0x + x = (0 + 1)x = 1x = x. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Similarly, $(-a)b = -(ab)$ since
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ ab + (-a)b = (a + (-a))b = 0b = 0. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Other familiar relations among the integers, e.g. $(-a)(-b) =
    ab$, may be deduced. ⦉
