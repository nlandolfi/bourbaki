\stitle{Rings}

\ssection{Why}

We generalize the algebraic structure of
addition and multiplication over the
integers.

\ssection{Definition}

A \ct{ring}{ring} is two algebras over
the same ground set with:
(1) the first algebra a commutative group
(2) an identity element in the second algebra,
and
(3) the operation of the second algebra
distributes over the operation of the first
algebra.

We call the operation of the first algebra
\ct{ring addition}{ringaddition}.
We call the operation of the second algebra
\ct{ring multiplication}{ringmultiplication}.
