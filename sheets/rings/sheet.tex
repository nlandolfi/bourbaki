\ssection{Why}

We generalize the algebraic structure of addition and multiplication over the integers.

\ssection{Definition}

A \t{ring} is two algebras over the same ground set with:
(1) the first algebra a commutative group
(2) an identity element in the second algebra,
and
(3) the operation of the second algebra
distributes over the operation of the first
algebra.

We call the operation of the first algebra
\t{ring addition}.
We call the operation of the second algebra
\t{ring multiplication}.

\ssection{Example}

Of course, $\Z$ with the usual operations is a ring.
