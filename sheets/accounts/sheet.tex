\ssection{Why}

We want to succinctly and unambiguously record statements about objects and sets of objects, keeping track of which names we are using.

\ssection{Definition}

We want to say the necessary and not the superfluous.
It is common in the history of mathematics to describe the development in English.
There are minor pitfalls to this.

%TODO: Ed. 2
We will not describe these here, but rather will give one example.
The first is that people of say \say{let $A$ be such and such}.
What they mean is \say{denote such and such by $A$} with a tacit assumption that you know that such and such means.
% Such and such may be some tangible object in the real world, or it may be some idea.
The practice is similar to using a pronoun.
If I say \say{Ben walks to the store} and then \say{He bought some brocolli,} we understand that \say{He} refers to Ben.
If I say \say{John walks to the store} and then \say{He bought some tofu,} we undersatnd that \say{He} refers to John.

The importance of using pronouns is relevant when we do not have proper names like Ben or John.
For example, suppose I say \say{The tall brown-haired thin man walks to the store} it saves quite a bit of sound to say \say{He} in the next thought, or even, \say{the man}.
% In these sheets we have used the pronouns it in many places, and will continue to do so.
These sheets include many other examples of using pronouns

Instead of \say{Let $A$ be such and such}, we will just write $\texttt{name} \; A$.
The idea is that we are introducing a name, $A$, that is some symbols to denote some object.
The use of a different font and the symbol \texttt{name} before $A$ is an abbreviation of the following: \say{Look at this symbol here $A$. This symbol is a reference for some object. It will always reference that object.}
% We will procede to say things about these objects.

For the statement that the object denoted by $A$ \textit{is} or \textit{is the same} or \textit{is the very same object} as the object denoted by $B$, we will use $=$.
So $=$we will write $A = B$.

If all we want to say is that two objects

We also need some way of identifying that two names


\begin{account}
  \name{$x$}
  \name{$y$}
  \have{a}{$x = y$}
\end{account}

\begin{account}
  \name{$x$}
  \name{$y$}
  \name{$z$}
  \have{a}{$x \subset y$}
  \have{b}{$y \subset z$}
  \thus{c}{$(\forall a)(a \in x \implies a \in y)$}{\ref{a}}
  \thus{d}{$(\forall a)(a \in y \implies a \in z)$}{\ref{b}}
  \thus{asdf}{$x \subset z$}{\ref{c},\ref{d}}
\end{account}

\begin{account}
  \nameee{$x$}{$y$}{$z$}
  \have{a}{$x \subset y$}
  \have{b}{$y \subset z$}
  \thus{c}{$(\forall a)(a \in x \implies a \in y)$}{\ref{a}}
  \thus{d}{$(\forall a)(a \in y \implies a \in z)$}{\ref{b}}
  \thus{asdf}{$x \subset z$}{\ref{c},\ref{d}}
\end{account}
