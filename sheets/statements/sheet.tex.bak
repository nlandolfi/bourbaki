\s{Why}

We want symbols to represent identity and belonging.
% We want to form say that objects are the same and that objects belong to sets.
% about objects.
% that some objects belong to some sets and that some names are equal.
% things about the relations between objects, and denote these relations using the names and other symbols.

\s{Definition}

In the English language, \t{nouns} are words that name people, places and things.
In these sheets, \t{names} (see \sheetref{names}{Names}) serve the role of nouns.
In the English language, \t{verbs} are words which talk about actions or relations.
In these sheets, we use the verbs \say{is} and \say{belongs} for the objects discussed.
% Particular verbs like \say{is} and \say{belongs} reference relationships between objects.
% These special symbols are meant
% In these sheets the nouns are names (see \sheetref{objects}{Objects}).
% The official verbs in these sheets will be \say{is} and \say{belongs}.
And we exclusively use the present tense.

Experience shows that we can avoid the English language and use symbols for verbs.
By doing this, we introduce odd new shapes and forms to which we can give specific meanings.
% Of course, the forms and symbols we will use are taken from other authors, and so have been given meanings there, and so there is still a possibility for confusion.
As we use italics for names to remind us that the symbol is denoting a possibly intangible arbitrary object, we use new symbols for verbs to remind us that we are using particular verbs, in a parituclar sense, with a particular tense.
% ), we use symbols  relations between objects to remind us that these relations have been given very particular meanings.
% We want to give particular meanings so that we know what we say, and to help avoid saying something which we have not said what it means.

% As an example, consider the symbol $\sim$.
% Let $a$ denote an object and $b$ denote an object.
% Let us suppose that these two objects are \say{similar,} and that we know what \say{similar} means.
% We might say that these objects are in the relationship of being similar, and.
% We might say, let $\sim$ mean \say{is similar to}.
% Then we might write $a \sim b$.
% It's an odd series of symbols, but a series of symbols nonetheless.
% And if we read it aloud, we would read $a$ as \say{the object denoted by a}, then $\sim$ as \say{is similar to}, then $b$ as \say{the object denoted by b}.
% Altogether then, \say{the object denoted by $a$ is similar to the object denoted by $b$.}
% As with names, we could box the several symbols used in this statement of similarity: \box{$a \sim b$} in order to clarify that they are meant to be taken together.
% But similar to how we do box English sentences, we wont box these sequences.
% In these sheets, we call a symbol like $\sim$ a \t{relational symbol}.
% Whereas a symbol like $a$ or $a'$ was a \t{name symbol}.
% We use the symbol $=$ for \say{is} and the symbol $\in$ for \say{belongs to}.


% But we will rely on the following.
% Whene
% Instead of using the English language, we will use symbols to mean certain statements.
% We need only speak of objects and their relations to other objects.
% In \sheetref{names}{Names} we said how we will denote objects.
% Now we need to say how we will denote relations.
%
% So far we have three kinds of sentences which we would like to record.
%
% \begin{enumerate}
%
%   \item
%   \textbf{Names}
%   We want to declare that we are using a particular name.
%   When we start with a blank slate, once we have declared a name we do not use the same name twice.
%   So we will want to keep track of which names are in use.
%
%   \item
%   \textbf{Identities}
%   We want to declare that two names are equal.
%   When we have names, we want to say when the identities of those names are the same.
%
%   \item
%   \textbf{Belongings}
%   We want to declare when the object represented by one name is an element of the set represented by a second name.
%
% \end{enumerate}
%
% Our main purpose is to keep a list of the statements we have made.
% Experience suggests that we start with an example.
%
% Suppose we want to summarize the following english language description of some names and objects.
% Denote an object by $a$.
% Denote the same object by $a'$
% In other words, $a$ equals $a'$.
% Denote a set by $A$.
% The object denoted by $a$ is an element of the set denoted by $A$.
%
% \begin{account}[Example]
% \name{$a$}
% \name{$a'$}
% \have{}{$a = a'$}
% \name{$A$}
% \have{}{$a \in A'$}
% \end{account}

% \s{Comparison to English}

\ss{Belonging}

Let $a$ denote an object, and let $A$ denote a set.
Then we say that the object denoted by $a$ belongs to the set denoted by $A$ by writing $a \in A$.
We read these symbols as \say{the object denoted by $a$ belongs to the set denoted by $A$}
\footnote{The symbol $\in$ is a stylized lower case Greek letter $\epsilon$, which is a mnemonic for the ancient greek word $\grave{\epsilon} \sigma \tau \acute{\iota}$ which means, roughly, \say{belongs}.
Since in English, $\epsilon$ is read aloud \say{ehp-sih-lawn,} $\in$ is also a mnemonic for \say{element of}.
}
% Of course, we must take care.
% The first name is not an element on the second name.
% Rather, the object denoted by the first name is an element of the set (object) denoted by the second name.

\ss{Identity}

As an example, consider the symbol $=$.
Let $a$ denote an object and $b$ denote an object.
Let us suppose that these two objects are \say{the same}.
In other words, the object denoted by $a$ is the same as the object denoted by $b$.
In the sense the sheet \sheetref{identities}{Identity} gives.
% and that we know what \say{similar} means.
% We might say that these objects are in the relationship of being similar, and.
We agree that $=$ means \say{is} in this sense.
Then we write $a = b$.
It's an odd series of symbols, but a series of symbols nonetheless.
And if we read it aloud, we would read $a$ as \say{the object denoted by a}, then $\sim$ as \say{is similar to}, then $b$ as \say{the object denoted by b}.
Altogether then, \say{the object denoted by $a$ is similar to the object denoted by $b$.}
As with names, we could box the several symbols used in this statement of similarity: \box{$a \sim b$} in order to clarify that they are meant to be taken together.
But similar to how we do box English sentences, we wont box these sequences.
% In these sheets, we call a symbol like $\sim$ a \t{relational symbol}.
% Whereas a symbol like $a$ or $a'$ was a \t{name symbol}.
We use the symbol $=$ for \say{is} and the symbol $\in$ for \say{belongs to}.

As a first example, we will have a symbol represent the English verb \say{is} in the sense of identity (as in \sheetref{identities}{Identities} discussed).
Consider the symbol $=$.

Now let $b$ denote an object.
We say that the object denoted by $a$ is the object denoted by $b$ by writing $a = b$.
%
% We say that these two verbs put two objects
%
% There
% There will only be two verbs and they are.
% There are only two verbs: equals
% We speak only in the present testand we have \t{relational symbols}.
% A \t{terminal} is a relational symbol, a left object and a right object.
% We will only make use of relational symb
%
% For now, denote a relational symbol by \fbox{$s$}.
% Denote a name by \fbox{$a$}
