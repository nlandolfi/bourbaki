\ssection{Why}

What is the distance between two points in space?

\ssection{Definition}

We define the distance between two points in space as the length of the line segment connecting them.
In terms of their coordinates $(x_1, x_2, x_3), (y_1, y_2, x_3) \in \R^3$, the \t{space distance} of two points is
\[
  \sqrt{(x_1 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - y_2)^2 + (x_3 - y_3)^2}.
\]
This is sometimes referred to as the \t{Euclidean distance}.
We have thus defined a function mapping $\R^3 \times \R^3$ into $\R$.
