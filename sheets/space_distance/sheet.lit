§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ What is the distance between two points in space? ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We define the distance between two points in space as the
    length of the line segment connecting them. ⦉

  ‖ In terms of their coordinates $(x_1, x_2, x_3), (y_1, y_2,
    x_3) ∈ 𝗥^3$, the ❬space distance❭ of two points is
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ √{(x_1 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - y_2)^2 + (x_3 - y_3)^2}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ This is sometimes referred to as the ❬Euclidean distance❭. ⦉

  ‖ We have thus defined a function mapping $𝗥^3 ×𝗥^3$ into $𝗥$. ⦉
