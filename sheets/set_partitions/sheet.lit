§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We divide a set into disjoint subsets whose union is the
    whole set. ⦉

  ‖ In this way we can handle each subset of the main set
    individually, and so handle the entire set piece by piece. ⦉
⦉

§ Decomposing a set ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Two sets $A$ and $B$ ❬divide❭ a set $X$ if $A ∪ B = X$
    and $A ∩ B = ∅$. ⦉

  ‖ Although every element is in either $A$ or $B$, no element
    is in both. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $X$ is a set. ⦉

  ‖ A set $F$ of subsets of $X$ is a ❬partition❭ (or
    ❬decomposition❭, ❬set partition❭) of $X$ if
    𝍫 ⦊
      ‣ $⋃ F = X$, ⦉

      ‣ $A ∩ B = ∅$ whenever $A, B ∈ F$, ⦉

      ‣ and $∅ ∉ F$. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ In other words, $F$ is a set of ‹nonempty› ‹pairwise
    disjoint› subsets of $X$ covering $X$. ⦉

  ‖ Other terminology used to describe condition (2) is ❬mutually
    exclusive❭ and ❬nonoverlapping❭. ⦉

  ‖ Other terminology used to describe condition (1) is that the
    sets are ❬collectively exhaustive❭. ⦉

  ‖ We call the elements of a partition the ❬parts❭ (or
    ❬pieces❭, ❬blocks❭, ❬cells❭) of the partition. ⦉
⦉

§§ Other terminology ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Occasionally, the term ❬unlabeled partition❭ is used, and the
    term ‹partition› is reserved for a separate concept. ⦉

  ‖ In this case, the term ❬allocation❭ is sometimes used as an
    abbreviation for unlabeled partition. ⦉
