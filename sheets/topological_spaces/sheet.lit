§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to generalize the notion of continuity. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬topological space❭ is a base set and a set
    distinguisehed subsets of this set for which: ⦉

  ‖ (1) the empty set base set are distinguised (2) the
    intersection of a finite family of distinguished subsets is
    distinguished, and (3) the union of a family of distinguished
    subsets is distinguished. ⦉

  ‖ We call the set of distinguished subsets the ❬topology❭ and
    we call its members the ❬open sets❭. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $X$ be a non-empty set. ⦉

  ‖ For the set of distinguished sets, we tend to use $𝒯$, a
    mnemonic for topology, read aloud as “script T”. ⦉

  ‖ We tend to denote elements of $𝒯$ by $O$, a mnemonic for
    open. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the topological space with base set $X$ and
    topology $𝒯$ by $(X, 𝒯)$. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the properties satisfied by elements of $𝒯$:
    𝍫 ⦊
      ‣ $X, ∅ ∈ 𝒯$ ⦉

      ‣ $\set{O_i}_{i = 1}^{n} ⊂ 𝒯 ⟹ ∩_{i = 1}^{n} O_i ∈ 𝒯$ ⦉

      ‣ $\set{O_α}_{α ∈ I} ⊂ 𝒯 ⟹ ∪_{α ∈ I} ∈ 𝒯$ ⦉

§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ $𝗥$ with the open intervals as the open sets is a
    topological space. ⦉
