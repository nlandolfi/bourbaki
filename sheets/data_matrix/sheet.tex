\ssection{Why}

We want to use the notation and language of matrices to discuss datasets.

\ssection{Definition}

The \t{data matrix} corresponding to a data set of $n$ records which are length $d$ tuples of real numbers is the $n$ by $d$ matrix whose $i$th row is the $i$ element of the data set.
Some authors refer to the data matrix as the \t{design matrix}.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(a^1, \dots, a^n)$ where $a^i \in \R^n$ for $i = 1, \dots, n$.
Let $A$ be the $n \times d$ matrix whose rows are the $a^i$.  Then $A$ is the data matrix of $(a^1, \dots, a^n)$.
In other words,
\[
  A = \pmat{ (a^1)^\top \\ \cdots \\ (a^n)^{\top}}.
\]
