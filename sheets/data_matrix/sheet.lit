§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬data matrix❭ corresponding to a data set of $n$
    records which are length $d$ tuples of real numbers is the
    $n$ by $d$ matrix whose $i$th row is the $i$ element of
    the data set. ⦉

  ‖ Some authors refer to the data matrix as the ❬design
    matrix❭. ⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(a^1, …, a^n)$ where $a^i ∈ 𝗥^n$ for $i = 1, …, n$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $A$ be the $n × d$ matrix whose rows are the $a^i$.
    Then $A$ is the data matrix of $(a^1, …, a^n)$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ A = \bmat{ (a^1)^⊤ ᜶ ⋯ ᜶ (a^n)^{⊤}}. ⦉
