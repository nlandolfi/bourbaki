\section*{Why}

We want to convert a subset of a vector space into a subspace.

\section*{Definition}

The \t{span} of a subset of a vector space is the intersection of all subspaces which contain that subset.
Since the intersection of a family of subspaces is a subspace, so too is the span.
Indeed, the span of a subset is contained in every subspace containing the set.

A subset of a vector space \t{spans} a subspace if its span is that subspace.
For example, the subspace may be a vector space, in which case the subset spans the entire space.
In this case we say that the subset \t{spans the space}.

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $V$ be a vector space and let $x_1, \dots , x_n \in V$.
We denote the span of these vectors by $\span\set{x_1, \dots , x_n}$

\section*{Examples}

The empty set is contained in every subspace, so the span of the empty set is the zero vector space.
