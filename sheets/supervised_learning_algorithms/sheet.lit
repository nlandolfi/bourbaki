  ‖ We sometimes use special language for a function inductor,
    which alludes to its similarities with “learning.” ⦉

⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $\CU$ and $\CV$ be sets and let $\set{G_n: (\CU ×
    \CV)^n → \powerset{X × Y}}_{n ∈ 𝗡}$ be a family of
    functional inductors. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose we have a dataset $(u^1, v^1), …, (u^n, u^n) ∈ \CU
    × \CV$, and we use our inductor (i.e., learning algorithm)
    to produce a predictor $f: \CU → \CY$ defined by $f \equiv
    G_m(a^1, …, a^m)$. ⦉

  ‖ Thus, we have a sequence of predictors $f^1, …, f^n$. ⦉

  ‖ We can evaluate our learning algorithm on th ⦉

  ‖ A predictor can be used to “guess” inputs which do not
    necessarily appear in the dataset. ⦉

  ‖ For this reason, some authors call an inductor (or family
    of inductors) a ❬learner❭ or ❬learning algorithm❭. ⦉

  ‖ In accordance with this usage, they refer to the argument
    of an inductor as the ❬training data❭ or ❬training dataset❭
    or ❬training set❭. ⦉

  ‖ As with our terminology dataset, the word “set,” however,
    may mislead since since we are speaking of a sequence. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ It is common to refer to the construction a predictor from
    a dataset a ❬learning problem❭. ⦉

  ‖ In this case, the learning problem is said to be
    ❬supervised learning❭. ⦉

  ‖ By supervision, we mean to indicate that we have the
    outputs corresponding to the inputs. ⦉

  ‖ In line with this usage, the outputs are often called
    ❬labels❭ and the labels are said “❬supervise❭” or “to provide
    supervision.” ⦉

  ‖ Since a predictor can be used to ❬guess❭ the output of an
    input, some authors call an inductor (or family of inductors)
    a ❬learner❭ or ❬learning algorithm❭ or ❬supervised learning
    algorithm❭ and refer to the argument as the ❬training
    dataset❭. ⦉

  ‖ Often the word “supervised” is included, as in ❬supervised
    learning❭. ⦉

  ‖ This language intends to indicate that inputs are given
    along with outputs, and these outputs “provide supervision to
    the algorithm.” ⦉
