§ Why ⦉

‖ We generalize the notion of sequence to index sets beyond the
  naturals. ⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A sequence is a function on the natural numbers; this set
    has two important properties: (a) we can order the natural
    numbers and (b) we can always go “further out.” ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ To elaborate on property (b): ⦉

  ‖ if handed two natural numbers ⦉

  ‖ $m$ and $n$, ⦉

  ‖ we can always find another, ⦉

  ‖ for example $\max\set{m,n}+1$, ⦉

  ‖ larger than $m$ and $n$. ⦉

  ‖ We might think of larger as ⦉

  ‖ “further out” from the ⦉

  ‖ first natural number: 1. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Now combine these two observations. ⦉

  ‖ A ❬directed set❭ is a set $D$ with a partial order $≼$
    satisfying one additional property: for all $a, b ∈ D$,
    there exists $c ∈ D$ such that $a ≼ c$ and $b ≼ c$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬net❭ is a function on a directed set. ⦉
⦉

§§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A sequence, then, is a net. ⦉

  ‖ The directed set is the set of natural numbers and the
    partial order is $m ≼ n$ if $m ≤ n$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Consider $𝗡 × 𝗡$, and write $(a,b) ≼ (c, d)$ if $a ≤ c$
    ‹and› $b ≤ d$. ⦉

  ‖ Clearly, $(𝗡^2, ≼)$ so defined is a partially ordered set. ⦉

  ‖ Notice that given $a = (a_1, a_2)$ and $b = (b_1, b_2)$
    the point $(\max(a_1, b_1), \max(a_2, b_2))$ succeeds or is
    equal to both $a$ and $b$. ⦉

  ‖ Thus $(𝗡^2, ≼)$ is a directed set on which we can define
    a net. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Directed sets involve a set and a partial order. ⦉

  ‖ We commonly assume the partial order, and just denote the
    set. ⦉

  ‖ We use the letter $D$ as a mnemonic for directed. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ For nets, we use function notation and generalize sequence
    notation. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the net $x: D → A$ by $\{a_{α}\}$, emulating
    notation for sequences. ⦉

  ‖ The use of $α$ rather than $n$ reminds us that $D$ need
    not be the set of natural numbers. ⦉
