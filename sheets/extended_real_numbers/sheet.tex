\ssection{Why}

That some limits grow without bound leads us to add two elements to the set of real numbers.

\ssection{Definition}

The set of
\t{extended real numbers}
is the union of
the set of real numbers
with a set containing
two elements:
one we call
\t{positive infinity}
and we call
\t{negative infinitty}.

\ssubsection{Extended Arithmetic}

We extend addition to all
but one ordered pair of elements
of the new set.
The sum of any real number with
a real number is defined as before.
The sum any real number with positive
infinity is positive infinity.
The sum any real number with negative
infinity is negative infinity.
The sum of positive infinity with
positive infinity is positive infinity.
The sum of negative infinity with
negative infinity is negative infinity.
We do not define the sum of
positive infinity and negative infinity.


\ssubsection{Notation}

We denote the element positive infinity by $+\infty$ and the element negative infinity by $-\infty$.
We denote the set of extended real numbers by $\Rbar$.
In other words, $\Rbar = \R \union \set{+\infty,-\infty}$.
