§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ That some sequences grow without bound leads us to add two
    elements to the set of real numbers. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The set of ❬extended real numbers❭ is the union of the set
    of real numbers with a set containing two elements: one we
    call ❬positive infinity❭ and we call ❬negative infinitty❭. ⦉
⦉

§ Extended arithmetic ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We extend addition to all ⦉

  ‖ but one ordered pair of elements ⦉

  ‖ of the new set. ⦉

  ‖ The sum of any real number with ⦉

  ‖ a real number is defined as before. ⦉

  ‖ The sum any real number with positive ⦉

  ‖ infinity is positive infinity. ⦉

  ‖ The sum any real number with negative ⦉

  ‖ infinity is negative infinity. ⦉

  ‖ The sum of positive infinity with ⦉

  ‖ positive infinity is positive infinity. ⦉

  ‖ The sum of negative infinity with ⦉

  ‖ negative infinity is negative infinity. ⦉

  ‖ We do not define the sum of ⦉

  ‖ positive infinity and negative infinity. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the element positive infinity by $+∞$ and the
    element negative infinity by $-∞$. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the set of extended real numbers by $\Rbar$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, $\Rbar = 𝗥 ∪ \set{+∞,-∞}$. ⦉
