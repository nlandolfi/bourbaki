§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ That some sequences grow without bound leads us to add two
    elements to the set of real numbers. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The set of ❬extended real numbers❭ is the union of the set
    of real numbers with a set containing two elements: one
    which we call ❬positive infinity❭ and the other we call
    ❬negative infinity❭. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote positive infinity by $+∞$ and the negative
    infinity by $-∞$. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the set of extended real numbers by $\Rbar$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, $\Rbar = 𝗥 ∪ \set{+∞,-∞}$. ⦉
⦉

§ Extended arithmetic ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We extend addition to all but one ordered pair of elements
    of the new set. ⦉

  ‖ The sum of any real number with a real number is defined
    as before. ⦉

  ‖ The sum any real number with positive infinity is positive
    infinity. ⦉

  ‖ The sum any real number with negative infinity is negative
    infinity. ⦉

  ‖ The sum of positive infinity with positive infinity is
    positive infinity. ⦉

  ‖ The sum of negative infinity with negative infinity is
    negative infinity. ⦉

  ‖ We do not define the sum of positive infinity and negative
    infinity. ⦉
⦉
