§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ That some sequences grow without bound leads us to add two
    elements to the set of real numbers. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The set of ❬extended real numbers❭ is the union of the set
    of real numbers with a set containing two elements: one
    which we call ❬positive infinity❭ and the other we call
    ❬negative infinity❭. ⦉

  ‖ We call an element of the extended real numbers ❬finite❭ if
    it is not positive or negative infinity. ⦉

  ‖ Otherwise, we call it ❬infinite❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The only two infinite extended real numbers are exactly the
    two elements positive and negative infinity. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote positive infinity by $+∞$ and the negative
    infinity by $-∞$. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the set of extended real numbers by $\Rbar$ so
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \Rbar = 𝗥 ∪ \set{-∞, +∞} ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

§ Intervals ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We extend intervals in the obvious way. ⦉

  ‖ We define
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ [-∞, α) := \Set{x ∈ 𝗥}{x <α} ∪ \set{-∞} ⦉
    ⦉
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ [-∞, α] := \Set{x ∈ 𝗥}{x ≤ α} ∪ \set{-∞} ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Similarly,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ (α, +∞] := \Set{x ∈ 𝗥}{x > α} ∪ \set{+∞} ⦉
    ⦉
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ [α, +∞] := \Set{x ∈ 𝗥}{x ≥ α} ∪ \set{+∞} ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ We to obtain useful notation if we make these open
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ (-∞, α) := \Set{x ∈ 𝗥}{x <α} ⦉
    ⦉
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ (-∞, α] := \Set{x ∈ 𝗥}{x ≤ α} ⦉
    ⦉
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ (α, +∞) := \Set{x ∈ 𝗥}{x > α} ⦉
    ⦉
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ (α, +∞) := \Set{x ∈ 𝗥}{x ≥ α} ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Finally, we sometimes denote $𝗥$ by $(-∞, ∞)$ and $\Rbar$
    by $[-∞, +∞]$, referring to the ❬real line❭ and ❬extended
    real line❭ respectively. ⦉

  ‖ We refer to any of the aforementioned sets as ❬extended
    real intervals❭. ⦉

  ‖ The following notations are sometime useful
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \Rbar_+ := [0, ∞] \quad \text{ and } \quad \Rbar_{++}
        := (0, ∞]. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  § Extended order ⦉
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Naturally, we define $-∞ < a < +∞$ for every $α ∈ 𝗥$. ⦉

    ‖ This new extended order can be put to good use, mostly
      notationally. ⦉

    ‖ For example, the intervals above can be rewritten by
      selecting $x$ from $\Rbar$. ⦉

    ‖ As a particular example, we can write
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ [-∞, α] =\Set{x ∈ \Rbar}{-∞ ≤ x ≤ α} ⦉
      ⦉
      and likewise for the other sets. ⦉
  ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ It is logically consistent to define the greatest lower
      bound of the empty set to be $+∞$ and likwise the least
      upper bound of the empty set to be $-∞$. ⦉

    ‖ In symbols,
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ \inf ∅ := +∞ \quad \text{ and } \quad \sup ∅ = -∞ ⦉
      ⦉⦉
  ⦉

  § Extended arithmetic ⦉
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ We extend addition to all but one ordered pair of
      elements of the new set. ⦉
    𝍫 ⦊
      ‣ ‖ The sum of any real number with a real number is defined as
          before. ⦉⦉

      ‣ ‖ The sum of positive infinity with positive infinity is
          positive infinity. ⦉

        ‖ The sum any real number with positive infinity is
          positive infinity. ⦉

        ‖ In symbols,
          ◇ ⦊
            ‖ α + ∞ = ∞ + α = ∞ \quad \text{for } -∞ < α ≤
              ∞ ⦉
          ⦉⦉⦉

      ‣ ‖ The sum any real number with negative infinity is negative
          infinity. ⦉

        ‖ The sum of negative infinity with negative infinity is
          negative infinity. ⦉

        ‖ In symbols,
          ◇ ⦊
            ‖ α - ∞ = -∞ + α = -∞ \quad \text{for } -∞ ≤ x
              < ∞ ⦉
          ⦉⦉⦉
    ⦉

    ‖ We do not define the sum of positive infinity and
      negative infinity. ⦉

    ‖ In other words, the combinations $∞ - ∞$ and $-∞ + ∞$
      are undefined and are avoided. ⦉
  ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Similarly, we extend multiplication
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ α∞ = ∞α = ∞, \quad α(-∞) = (-∞)α = -∞ \quad
          \text{for } 0 < α ≤ ∞, ⦉
      ⦉
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ α∞ = ∞α = -∞, \quad α(-∞) = (-∞)α = ∞ \quad
          \text{for } -∞ ≤ < α < 0, ⦉
      ⦉
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ 0∞ = ∞0 = 0 = 0(-∞) = (-∞)0, \quad -(-∞) = ∞ ⦉
      ⦉⦉
  ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Under these rules, the familiar laws remain commutative,
      associative, and multiplication distributes over addition. ⦉

    ‖ This is provided, of course, that we never form the sum
      $∞ - ∞$ or $-∞ + ∞$. ⦉

    ‖ These can be verified by testing all possible finte
      combinations for the values in the laws. ⦉

    ‖ Avoiding a forbidden sum requires some cautious attention,
      like dividing by zero, and in practice one or the other
      of the infinities tends to be excluded by hypothesis. ⦉
