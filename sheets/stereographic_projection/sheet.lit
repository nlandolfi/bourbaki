§ Why ⦉
† ⦊
  ‖ Future editions will include, the historical motivation is
    obviously cartography. ⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $S$ be the sphere in $𝗥^3$ and let $N = (0, 0, 1)$,
    the north pole. ⦉

  ‖ Then the ❬stereopgraphic projection❭ of $S - \set{N}$ is the
    function $π: S - \set{N} → 𝗥^2$ defined as follows. ⦉

  ‖ The point $π(p)$ is the $(x, y)$ values for the point
    where the line through $N$ and $p$ intersects the plane
    plane $P = \set{(x, y, z) ∈ 𝗥^3}{z = 0}$ (the “xy-plane”).
