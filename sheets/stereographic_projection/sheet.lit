§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to make physical two dimensional images of parts of
    the earth's surface. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, we want to make maps. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Denote the unit sphere in $𝗥^3$ by $S$ and the northpole
    $(0, 0, 1) ∈ S$ by $p$. ⦉

  ‖ Denote the sphere without the nortpole by $S^∘$.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will resolve the fact that this conflicts
        with the notion of polar sets (see

  ‖ In other words, $S^∘$ is defined by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ S^∘ = S ∖ \set{p} ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ The ❬stereopgraphic projection❭ $π: S^∘ → 𝗥^2$ of $S^∘$ is
    defined as follows. ⦉

  ‖ The point $π(x)$ is the $(x, y)$ value for the point where
    the line through $N$ and $x$ intersects the plane $P =
    \Set{(x, y, z) ∈ 𝗥^3}{z = 0}$ (the “xy-plane”).
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will improve and continue the development
        as well as include the requisite figures. ⦉
