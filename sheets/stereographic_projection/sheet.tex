\footnote{Future editions will include, the historical motivation is obviously cartography.}
\section*{Definition}

Let $S$ be the sphere in $\R ^3$ and let $N = (0, 0, 1)$, the north pole.
Then the \t{stereopgraphic projection} of $S - \set{N}$ is the function $\pi : S - \set{N} \to \R ^2$ defined as follows.
The point $\pi (p)$ is the $(x, y)$ values for the point where the line through $N$ and $p$ intersects the plane plane $P = \set{(x, y, z) \in \R ^3}{z = 0}$ (the ``xy-plane'').\footnote{Future editions will expand.}

\begin{proposition}
The stereographic projection is a diffeomorphism.
\end{proposition}
