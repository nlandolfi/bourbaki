\ssection{Why}

Often we care about multiple criteria at once.\footnote{Future editions will modify.}

\ssection{Definition}

A \t{multiobjective optimization problem} is a pair $(X, f: X \to \R^d)$.
As before, $X$ is the \t{constraint set} and $f$ is called the \t{objective function}.
Since $f$ is vector valued, and there is no natural order on $\R^d$, there may exist $x \in X$ with non-comparable images under $f$.

\ssection{Scalarization}

The $\alpha \in \R^d$ \t{scalarization} of a multiobjective optimization problem $(X, f)$ is the optimization problem $(X, g)$ where $g: X \to \R$ is defined by $g(x) = \alpha^\tp f(x)$.
We call $g$ the \t{scalarized objective}.
