§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Often we care about multiple criteria at once.

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬multiobjective optimization problem❭ is a pair $(X, f: X
    → 𝗥^d)$. ⦉

  ‖ As before, $X$ is the ❬constraint set❭ and $f$ is called
    the ❬objective function❭. ⦉

  ‖ Since $f$ is vector valued, and there is no natural order
    on $𝗥^d$, there may exist $x ∈ X$ with non-comparable images
    under $f$. ⦉
⦉

§ Scalarization ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The $α ∈ 𝗥^d$ ❬scalarization❭ of a multiobjective
    optimization problem $(X, f)$ is the optimization problem $(X,
    g)$ where $g: X → 𝗥$ is defined by $g(x) = α^\tp f(x)$. ⦉

  ‖ We call $g$ the ❬scalarized objective❭. ⦉
