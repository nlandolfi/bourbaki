\ssection{Why}

We speak of objects which we can add and scale.

\ssection{Definition}

A \t{vector space} is a tuple of three objects:
(1) a commutative group, (2) a field, and (3) a function from the product of the field ground set and group ground set to the group ground set.
%Before giving the properties,
%let us name these.

We call the ground set of the commutative group the \ct{vectors}{vectors} and we call the group operation \ct{vector addition}{vector addition}.
We call the field the \ct{scalars}{scalars}.
The field has addition and multiplication of scalars which we call \t{scalar addition} and \t{scalar multiplication}, respectively.
The
\ct{scaling map}{scalingmap}
is the map on
pairs of scalars and vectors.

The first property is that
the result of scaling a
vector by a scalar, and then
scaling the result by a
second scalar is the same
as first multiplying the
scalars and then scaling
the vector.
The second property is that
the result of
scaling a vector
by the scalar sum of two
scalars is the same
as scaling the vector
by each scalar separately
and then adding the vectors.
The third property is that
the result
of scaling the vector sum
of two vectors is the
same as scaling each
individually and then adding
the two vectors.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(V,+)$ be a commutative
group and $(F, \tilde{+}, \cdot)$
be a field.
Let $s: F \times V \to V$.
$((V, +), (F, \tilde{+}, \cdot), s)$
is a vector space if
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $s(b,s(a, v)) = s(b \cdot a, v)$ for all $a, b \in F$ and $v \in V$.
  \item $s(a\tilde{+}b, v) = s(a, v) + s(b, v)$ for all $a, b \in F$ and $v \in V$.
  \item $s(a, u + v) = s(a,u) + s(a, b)$ for all $a \in F$ and $u, v \in V$.
\end{enumerate}

We now introduce four notational
simplifications.

First, we denote both vector
and scalar addition by $+$.
So $a + b$ denotes $a \tilde{+} b$
for all $a, b \in F$.
Second,
we contract $\cdot$
So $ab$ denotes $a \cdot b$
for all $a, b \in F$.
Third, we
contract the scaling map.
So $av$ denotes $s(a, v)$
for $a \in F$ and $v \in V$.
Fourth,
we take the scaling
map to have precedence so that
$au + av$ means $(au) + (av)$
for all $a \in F$ and $u,v \in V$.

We denote:
(1)
$b(av) = (ba)v$;
(2)
$(a+b)v = av + bv$;
and (3)
$a(u + v) = au + av$
for all
$a,b \in F$ and $u, v \in V$.

Finally, we say: let $(V, F)$
be a vector space, assuming the
above notational conventions.
