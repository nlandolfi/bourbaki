\section*{Why}

Often the chain considered in optimization is the real numbers.

\section*{Definition}

A function from a non-empty set to the real numbers, in the context of optimizers, is called an \t{objective function} for the \t{feasible set} (its domain).
Suppose the feasible set is a subset of real numbers.
Often we can specify a function defined for every real number.
The \t{objective function} is the restriction of this function to those elements which are \t{feasible}.

\section*{Notation}

Let $D$ be a non-empty set, a mnemonic for ``domain.''
Let $f: D \to \R $.
Often we have $g: A \to \R $, where $D \subset A$.
So $f$ is the restriction of $g$ to the feasible set $D$.
In this case the language feasible set language is especially useful
% In this case the language feasible set language is especially useful, as an correspond to a mimimal element of $g(A)$, a larger set than $g(D)$.
% In this case, it is useful to speak of feasible elements.
