§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Often the chain considered in optimization is the real
    numbers. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A function from a non-empty set to the real numbers, in
    the context of optimizers, is called an ❬objective function❭
    for the ❬feasible set❭ (its domain). ⦉

  ‖ Suppose the feasible set is a subset of real numbers. ⦉

  ‖ Often we can specify a function defined for every real
    number. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬objective function❭ is the restriction of this function
    to those elements which are ❬feasible❭. ⦉
⦉

§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $D$ be a non-empty set, a mnemonic for “domain.” ⦉

  ‖ Let $f: D → 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ Often we have $g: A → 𝗥$, where $D ⊂ A$. ⦉

  ‖ So $f$ is the restriction of $g$ to the feasible set $D$. ⦉

  ‖ In this case the language feasible set language is
    especially useful ⦉

  <!--
 In this case the language feasible set language is especially useful, as an correspond to a mimimal element of $g(A)$, a larger set than $g(D)$.
 In this case, it is useful to speak of feasible elements.
