\section*{Why}

We want to add and multiply complex numbers.\footnote{Future editions will expand in the genetic account for introducing complex numbers.}

\section*{Definition}

Let $z_1, z_2 \in \C $ with $z_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $z_2 = (x_2, y_2)$.
The \t{complex product} of $z_1$ and $z_2$ is the complex number $(x_1x_2 - y_1y_2, x_1y_2 + y_1x_2)$.

\section*{Properties}

\begin{proposition}[Distributivity]
For all $z_1, z_2, z_3 \in \C $, we have
$z_1(z_2 + z_3)$ and $z_1z_2 + z_1z_3$
\end{proposition}

\subsection*{Relaton to $\R ^2$}

Addition in $\C $ corresponds to the usual addition of the corresponding vectors in the plane $\R ^2$.
In other words, it corresponds to element-wise addition.
However multiplication in $\C $ is \textit{not} componentwise multiplication in $\R ^2$.
