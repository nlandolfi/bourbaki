§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to add and multiply complex numbers.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will expand in the genetic account for
        introducing complex numbers. ⦉

⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $z_1, z_2 ∈ 𝗖$ with $z_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $z_2 =
    (x_2, y_2)$. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬complex product❭ of $z_1$ and $z_2$ is the complex
    number $(x_1x_2 - y_1y_2, x_1y_2 + y_1x_2)$. ⦉
⦉

§ Properties ⦉
<statement type='proposition' text='Distributivity'>
  ‖ For all $z_1, z_2, z_3 ∈ 𝗖$, we have ⦉

  ‖ $z_1(z_2 + z_3)$ and $z_1z_2 + z_1z_3$ ⦉
</statement>

§§ Relaton to $𝗥^2$ ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Addition in $𝗖$ corresponds to the usual addition of the
    corresponding vectors in the plane $𝗥^2$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, it corresponds to element-wise addition. ⦉

  ‖ However multiplication in $𝗖$ is ‹not› componentwise
    multiplication in $𝗥^2$. ⦉
