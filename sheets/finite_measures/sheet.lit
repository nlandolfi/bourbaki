§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want finite measures.
    † ⦊
      ‖ This why is likely to be expanded on in future
        editions. It may be that we need to reference probability
        theory. It may suffice to note that the Lebesgue measure
        on $[0, 1]$ is finite, and so such measures exist. ⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A measurable set is ❬measure-finite❭ (or when clear that we
    do not mean finite in the sense of␣
    <a href='/sheets/finite_sets.html'>
      ‖ Finite sets ⦉
    </a>
    ), a set is ❬finite❭) if its measure is a real number (as
    opposed to the only alternative, $+∞$). ⦉

  ‖ The measure space itself is ❬measure-finite❭ if the base set
    is finite. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A measurable set is ❬sigma-finite❭ if there exists a
    sequence of finite measurable sets whose union is the set.
    † ⦊
      ‖ The justification of this seems distinct from the
        previous paragraph, and therefore may need its own sheet.
        The reason for these seems to be that the Lebesgue
        measure is sigma-finite. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ The measure space itself is ❬sigma-finite❭ if the base set
    is sigma finite. ⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(A, 𝒜, μ)$ be a measure space. ⦉

  ‖ It is finite if $μ(A) < +∞$. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='example'>
  ‖ Let $(A, 𝒜)$ be a measurable space. ⦉
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ The counting measure on $(A, 𝒜)$ is ⦉

    ‖ finite if and only if the base set is finite. ⦉

    ‖ It is sigma finite if and only if the base ⦉

    ‖ set is a union of a sequence of finite sets. ⦉
  ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ If $𝒜 = 2^A$, then the counting ⦉

    ‖ measure is sigma finite if and only if ⦉

    ‖ $A$ is countable. ⦉
