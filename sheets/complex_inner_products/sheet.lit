§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ What is an inner product if we take a vector space over
    the complex numbers. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ An inner produce over a complex vector space is positive
    definite, Hermitian, and linear in the first argument. ⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(V, 𝗖)$ be a complex vector space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $f: V ×V → C$ be a function such that
