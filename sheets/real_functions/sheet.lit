§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We name functions whose codomain is the real numbers. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬real function❭ is a real-valued function. ⦉

  ‖ The domain is often an interval of real numbers, but may
    be any non-empty set. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A$ be a set. ⦉

  ‖ Let $f: A → 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ $f$ is a real function. ⦉

  ‖ If $A = 𝗥$, then $f ∈ 𝗥 → 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ To speak of functions defined on intervals, let $a, b ∈ 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $g: [a, b] → 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $g$ is a real function defined on a closed interval. ⦉

  ‖ Let $h: (a, b) → 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $h$ is a real function defined on an open interval. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We regularly declare the interval and the function at once. ⦉

  ‖ For example, “let $f: [a, b] → 𝗥$” is understood to mean
    “let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers with $a < b$, let $[a,
    b]$ be the closed interval with them as endpoints, and let
    $f$ bea real-valued function whose domain is this interval”. ⦉

  ‖ We read the notation $f: [a, b] → 𝗥$ aloud as “$f$ from
    closed $a$ $b$ to $𝗥$.” ⦉

  ‖ We use $f: (a, b) → 𝗥$ similarly (read aloud “$f$ from
    open $a$ $b$ to $𝗥$”). ⦉
⦉

§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ \begin{expl} ⦉

  ‖ Let $c ∈ 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $f: 𝗥 → 𝗥$ be such that $f(x) = c$ for every $x ∈
    𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ $f$ is a real function. ⦉

  ‖ \end{expl} ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ \begin{expl} ⦉

  ‖ Let $f: 𝗥 → 𝗥$ with $f(x) = 2x^2 + 1$ for all $x ∈ R$. ⦉

  ‖ $f$ is a real function. ⦉
