\ssection{Why}

We define functions mapping
real numbers to real numbers.

\ssection{Definition}

A
\ct{real function}{}
is a real-valued function
on
a subset of real numbers.
The domain
is often an
interval.
%In this case,
%we say that the function
%is defined on a
%closed interval of
%the real line.
%We usually leave
%the codomain as
%the set of real numbers,
%unless we wish to speak
%of the function being onto.

\ssubsection{Notation}

$f: \R \to \R$. $f$ is a real
function.
To speak of functions defined
on intervals,
let $a, b \in \R$.
$g: [a, b] \to \R$.
is a real function
defined on a closed interval.
$h: (a, b) \to \R$
is a real function
defined on an open interval.

We regularly declare the interval
and the function in one pass:
Let $f: [a, b] \to \R$, read
aloud as \say{$f$ from
closed $a$ $b$ to $\R$.}
Or, let $f: (a, b) \to \R$
read aloud as
\say{$f$ from open $a$ $b$ to $\R$}.
