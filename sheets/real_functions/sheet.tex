\ssection{Why}

We define functions mapping
real numbers to real numbers.

\ssection{Definition}

A
\ct{real function}{}
is a function from
subset of the real
numbers into a
subset of the real numbers.
When clear from context,
we call a real function
a function.

Often, the domain is an
interval.
In this case,
we say that the function
is defined on a
closed interval of
the real line.
We usually leave
the codomain as
the set of real numbers,
unless we wish to speak
of the function being onto.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $R$ denote the set of
real numbers.
Let $f: R \to R$.
Then $f$ is a real function.

Let $a, b \in R$.
Let $[a, b] \subset R$
a closed interval of
real numbers.
Let $f: [a, b] \to R$.
Then $f$ is a real function
defined on a closed interval.

We regularly declare the interval
and the function in one pass:
Let $f: [a, b] \to R$, read
aloud as \say{$f$ from
closed $a$ $b$ to $R$.}
