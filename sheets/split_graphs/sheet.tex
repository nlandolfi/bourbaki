\section*{Why}

They are chordal.

\section*{Definition}

A \t{split graph} is an undirected graph whose vertices can be partitioned into two sets such that one set induces a complete subgraph and the other set has no edges between vertices.

\section*{Properties}

\begin{proposition}
The complement of a split graph is a split graph.

\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
A graph is a split graph if and only if it is chordal and has a chordal complement.\footnote{Future editions will include a proof.}

\end{proposition}
