\ssection{Why}

They are chordal.

\ssection{Definition}

A \t{split graph} is an undirected graph whose vertices can be partitioned into two sets such that one set induces a complete subgraph and the other set has no edges between vertices.

\ssection{Properties}

\begin{prop}

  The complement of a split graph is a split graph.

\end{prop}

\begin{prop}

  A graph is a split graph if and only if it is chordal and has a chordal complement.
