\section*{Why}

To every real-valued inner product there corresponds a norm, in a similar manner to the construction for $\R ^n$.

\section*{Definition}

\begin{proposition}
Let $(V, \F )$ be a vector space.
Let $f: V \times  V \to \F $ be an inner product with $f(x, x) \in \R $.
Let $g: V \to \R $ such that
  \[
g(x) = \sqrt{f(x, x)}.
  \]
Then $g$ is a norm.\end{proposition}
The \t{norm} of a vector in an inner product space is the square root of the inner product of the vector with itself.
