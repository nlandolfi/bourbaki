\ssection{Result}

\begin{prop}
  Let $A_1, \dots, A_n$ be a partition of a set of outcomes $A$.  Let $\PE$ be an event probability function for some probability mass function.
Let $B \subset A$ an event.
Then
\[
  \PE(B) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \PE(B \intersect A_i).\footnote{Future editions will inclue an account.}
\]
\end{prop}

This result is often known as the \t{law of total probability}.
