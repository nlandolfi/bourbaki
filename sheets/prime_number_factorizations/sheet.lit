§ Result ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Suppose $n ∈ 𝗡$ and $n > 1$. ⦉

  ‖ Then there exists a factorization $(π_1, …, π_p)$ of $n$
    where $π_i$ is prime for $i = 1, …, p$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ n = π_1π_2⋯π_p ⦉
    ⦉⦉
</statement>
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The above result is known as the ❬fundamental theorem of
    arithmetic❭ and the ❬prime factorization theorem❭. ⦉

  ‖ Future editions will include the proof. ⦉
