\begin{proposition}
Suppose $n \in \N  $ and $n > 1$.
Then there exists a factorization $(\pi _1, \dots , \pi _p)$ of $n$ where $\pi _i$ is prime for $i = 1, \dots , p$.
In other words,
\[
n = \pi _1\pi _2\cdots\pi _p
\]
\end{proposition}

The above result is known as the \t{fundamental theorem of arithmetic} and the \t{prime factorization theorem}.
Future editions will include the proof.
