\stitle{Function Images}

\ssection{Why}

We consider the set of results
of a set of domain elements.

\ssection{Definition}

The \ct{image}{} of a set
of domain elements under
a function is the set of
their results.
Though the set of domain elements
may include several distinct elements,
the image may still be a singleton,
since the function may map
all of elements to the same result.

The \ct{range}{} of a function
is the image of its domain.
The range includes all possible
results of the function.
If the range does not include
some element of the codomain,
then the function maps no
domain elements to that codomain
element.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $f: A \to B$.
We denote the image of $C \subset A$ by $f(C)$, read aloud as \say{f of C.}
This notation is overloaded: for every $c \in C$, $f(c) \in A$, whereas $f(C) \subset A$.
Read aloud, the two are indistinguishable, so we must be careful to specify whether we mean an element $c$ or a set $C$.
Following this notation for function images, we denote the range of $f$ by $f(A)$.
