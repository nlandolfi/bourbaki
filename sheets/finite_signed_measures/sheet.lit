§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ For the difference of two (signed) measures to be
    well-defined, we need one of the two to be finite. ⦉

  ‖ Otherwise, the measure of the difference on the base set
    involves subtracting $∞$ from $∞$. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬finite❭ signed measure is one for which the measure of
    every set is finite. ⦉

  ‖ This condition is equivalent to the base set having finite
    measure (see below). ⦉
⦉

§ Result ⦉
<statement id='prop:finitesignedmeasures' type='proposition'>
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ A signed measure is finite if and only if it is finite
      on the base set. ⦉
  ⦉
</statement>
<proof>
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜)$ be a measurable space. ⦉

    ‖ Let $μ: 𝒜 → \eri$ be a signed measure. ⦉
  ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ ($⇒$) If $μ$ is finite, then $μ(X)$ ⦉

    ‖ is finite since $X ∈ 𝒜$. ⦉
  ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ ($⇐)$ ⦉

    ‖ Next, suppose $μ(X)$ is finite. ⦉

    ‖ Let $A ∈ 𝒜$. ⦉

    ‖ Then $X = A \union (X - A)$, ⦉

    ‖ with these sets disjoint, ⦉

    ‖ so by countable additivity ⦉

    ‖ of $μ$, ⦉

    ‖ $μ(X) = μ(A) + μ(X - A)$. ⦉

    ‖ Since $μ(X)$ finite, $μ(A)$ ⦉

    ‖ and $μ(X - A)$ are both finite. ⦉
  ⦉
