\ssection{Why}

\ssection{Definition}

Two vectors in an inner product space are \t{orthogonal} if their inner product is zero.
An \t{orthogonal family of vectors} in an inner product space is a family of vectors for which distinct family members are orthogonal.
An \t{orthonormal family of vectors} in an inner product space is a family of vectors with unit norm.

\begin{prop}
  TODO: orthongal and nonzero can be made orthonormal.
\end{prop}
