§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Can we view the set of measures as a vector space? ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Not quite: the difference of two measures may take negative
    values on some set. ⦉

  ‖ This functional will be countably additive, however, and so
    behaves similar to a measure. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $ℱ$ is a sigma algebra. ⦉

  ‖ Then $f: ℱ → \Rbar$ is ⦉

  ‖ ❬countably additive❭ ⦉

  ‖ if the result of the function applied to ⦉

  ‖ the union of a disjoint countable family of ⦉

  ‖ distinguished sets is the limit of the partial ⦉

  ‖ sums of the results of the function applied ⦉

  ‖ to each of the sets individually. ⦉

  ‖ The limit of the partial sums must ⦉

  ‖ exist irregardless of the summand order. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ⦉

  ‖ ❬signed measure❭ ⦉

  ‖ is an extended-real-valued ⦉

  ‖ function on a ⦉

  ‖ sigma algebra that is ⦉

  ‖ (1) zero on the empty set and ⦉

  ‖ (2) countably additive. ⦉

  ‖ We call the result of the function ⦉

  ‖ applied to a set in the sigma ⦉

  ‖ algebra the ⦉

  ‖ ❬signed measure❭ ⦉

  ‖ (or when no ambiguity arises, the ⦉

  ‖ ❬measure❭) ⦉

  ‖ of the set. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ When speaking of a measure, which is non-negative, in
    contrast to a signed measure, we will call the former a
    ❬nonnegative measure❭ (or ❬positive measure❭). ⦉
⦉

§§ Basic properties ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ A signed measure never takes both positive infinity and
    negative infinity. ⦉
</statement>
<proof>
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜)$ be a measurable space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $μ: 𝒜 → \eri$ be a signed measure. ⦉

  ‖ First, suppose $μ(X)$ is finite, ⦉

  ‖ Then by ⦉

  ‖ Proposition~\ref{prop:finitesignedmeasures} ⦉

  ‖ $μ$ is finite for each $A ∈ 𝒜$. ⦉
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Suppose $μ(X) = ∈fty$. ⦉

    ‖ Let $A ∈ 𝒜$. ⦉

    ‖ As before, ⦉

    ‖ $μ(X) = μ(A) + μ(X - A)$. ⦉

    ‖ Since $μ(X) = +∞$, then ⦉

    ‖ both of $μ(A)$ and $μ(X-A)$ ⦉

    ‖ must be either finite or $+∈fty$. ⦉

    ‖ Argue similarly for $μ(X) = -∈fty$. ⦉
  ⦉
