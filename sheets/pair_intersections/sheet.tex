\section*{Why}

Does a set exist containing the elements shared between two sets?
How might we construct such a set?

\section*{Definition}

Let $A$ and $B$ denote sets.
Consider the set $\Set{x \in A}{x \in B}$.
This set exists by the principle of specification (see \sheetref{set_specification}{Set Specification}).
Moreover $(y \in \Set{x \in A}{x \in B}) \iff (y \in A \land y \in B)$.
In other words, $\Set{x \in A}{x \in B}$ contains all the elements of $A$ that are also elements of $B$.

We can also consider $\Set{x \in B}{x \in A}$, in which we have swapped the positions of $A$ and $B$.
Similarly, the set exists by the principle of specification (see \sheetref{set_specification}{Set Specification}) and again $y \in \Set{x \in B}{x \in A} \iff (y \in B \land y \in B)$.
Of course, $y \in A \land y \in B$ means the same as\footnote{Future editions will name and cite this rule.}
$y \in B \land y \in A$ and so by the principle of extension (see \sheetref{set_equality}{Set Equality})
\[
\Set{x \in A}{x \in B} = \Set{x \in B}{x \in A}.
\]
We call this set the \t{pair intersection} of the set denoted by $A$ with the set denoted by $B$.

\subsection*{Notation}

We denote the intersection fo the set denoted by $A$ with the set denoted by $B$ by $A \cap  B$.
We read this notation aloud as ``A intersect B''.

\subsection*{Basic properties}

All the following results are immediate.\footnote{Proofs of these results will appear in the next edition.}

\begin{proposition}
$A \cap  \varnothing = \varnothing$
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}[Commutativity]
$A \cap B = B \cap A$
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}[Associativity]
$(A \cap  B) \cap  C = A \cap  (B \cap  C)$
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
$A \cap  A = A$
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
$(A \subset B) \iff (A \cap B = A)$.
\end{proposition}
