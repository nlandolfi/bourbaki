§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to build vectors out of other vectors using scalar
    multiplication and vector addition. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬linear combination❭ ❬from❭ a $𝗥^n$ is an ordered pair:
    the first coordinate is a sequence of vectors and the second
    is a sequence in $𝗥$ (which we call the ❬scalars❭). ⦉

  ‖ The ❬result❭ of a linear combination is the sum of the
    results of scaling each vector by the corresponding scalar in
    the sequence; itself a vector in the space. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬trivial linear combination❭ is one whose sequence of
    scalars is zero at each coordinate. ⦉

  ‖ The result of any trivial linear combination is the zero
    vector. ⦉

  ‖ A ❬nontrivial linear combination❭ is one which is not
    trivial. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, to be nontrivial, there must exist at least
    one index of the scalar sequence whose corresponding value is
    nonzero. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We say that a given vector ❬can be written as a linear
    combination of❭ a sequence of vectors if there exists a
    sequence of scalars such that the result of the linear
    combination of that sequence of vectors and scalars is the
    given vector. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, a vector can be written as a linear
    combination of some other vectors if there exists scalars for
    those other vectors such that scaling them and adding the
    results gives the vector. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $v = (v_1, …, v_n)$ be a sequence of vectors in $𝗥^n$
    and ⦉

  ‖ $a = (a_1, …, a_n)$ be a sequence of scalars in $𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $(v, a)$ is a linear combination and we can express
    its result by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ a_1v_1 + a_2v_2 + ⋯ + a_n v_n. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ If $(v,a)$ is trivial, then $a_i = 0$ for $i ∈ \upto{n}$
    and the result of $(v, a)$ is $0$ (the zero vector). ⦉

  ‖ Otherwise, there exists $i ∈ \upto{n}$ such that $a_i ≠ 0$;
    of course, the result of $(v, a)$ may still be $0$. ⦉
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ A vector $u$ can be written as a linear combination of
      the vectors $v_1, v_2, …, v_n$ if there exists scalars
      $a_1, a_2, …, a_n$ so that
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ u = a_1v_1 + a_2v_2 + ⋯ + a_nv_n. ⦉
      ⦉⦉

    ‖ We often number (see␣
      <a href='/sheets/lists.html'>
        ‖ Lists ⦉
      </a>
      ) a finite set of vectors. ⦉

    ‖ In this case, we say “Let $\set{u_1, …, u_n}$ be a
      (finite) set of vectors.” ⦉
