\section*{Definition}

Given a group $(G, \circ)$ and a subset $H \subset G$, if $(H, \circ\mid _{\mid H})$ is a group then we call it a \t{subgroup} of $(G, \circ)$.
As we often refer to the group $G$ we we refer to $H$ as the subgroup.
If $H \subsetneq G$, we refer to $H$ as a \t{proper subgroup}.

\subsection*{Examples}

\textit{Trivial subgroup.}
Suppose $e \in G$ is the identity element of the group $(G, \circ)$.
Then $\set{e}$ is a subgroup of of $(G, \circ)$.
