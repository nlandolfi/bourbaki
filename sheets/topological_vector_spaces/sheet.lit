§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ For any␣
    <a href='/sheets/norms.html'>
      ‖ normed vector space ⦉
    </a>
    , the vector operations are continuous. ⦉

  ‖ We can abstract this notion. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬topological vector space❭ is triple whose first coordinate
    is a vector space, whose second coordinate is a topology on
    the field of the vector space and whose third coordinate is
    a topology on the set of vectors, ‹such that› the vector
    operations are ‹continuous› with respect to their␣

    . ⦉
⦉

§ Motivating example ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Suppose $(V, \norm{·})$ is a normed vector space. ⦉

  ‖ Then the vector operations are continuous with respect to
    the topology induced by the metric induced by the norm. ⦉
