\section*{Why}

For any \sheetref{norms}{normed vector space}, the vector operations are continuous.
We can abstract this notion.

\section*{Definition}

A \t{topological vector space} is triple whose first coordinate is a vector space, whose second coordinate is a topology on the field of the vector space and whose third coordinate is a topology on the set of vectors, \textit{such that} the vector operations are \textit{continuous} with respect to their \sheetref{product_topologies}{product topologies}.

\section*{Motivating example}

\begin{proposition}
Suppose $(V, \norm{\cdot })$ is a normed vector space.
Then the vector operations are continuous with respect to the topology induced by the metric induced by the norm.
\end{proposition}
