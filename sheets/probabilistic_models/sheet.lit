§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We have a space $X$ and a family of probability measures
    $𝒫$ on this space. ⦉

  ‖ Assume $x ∈ X$ drawn from a fixed, unknown measure $P ∈
    𝒫$. ⦉

  ‖ Given $x$, how should we guess $P$? ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬probabilistic model❭ (or ❬statistical model❭, ❬parametric
    statistical model❭, ❬statistical experiment❭) is a family of
    probability measures over the same measurable space $(X, ℱ)$. ⦉

  ‖ Call the index set the ❬parameter set❭ or ❬set of
    parameters❭. ⦉

  ‖ The set $X$ is called the ❬sample space❭. ⦉

  ‖ A ❬statistic❭ is any function on the sample space. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, ℱ)$ denote a measurable space. ⦉

  ‖ We usually denote the parameter by $Θ$, and denote the
    family
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ 𝒫 = \Set{𝗣_θ: ℱ → [0,1]}{𝗣_θ \text{ a measure}, θ ∈ Θ}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Often $Θ ⊂ 𝗥^d$. ⦉

  <!-- montanari has an additional stipulation on 𝒫 -->
⦉

§§ Example: coin flips ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The usual model for $n$ flips of a coin takes $X =
    \set{0,1}^n$, the set of binary $n$-tuples. ⦉

  ‖ For $θ ∈ [0, 1]$, a distribution $p_θ(x) = θ^t(1-θ)^{n-t}$
    where $t = t(x) = x_1 + ⋯ + x_n$ is defined on $X$. ⦉

  ‖ A probability measure $𝗣_θ$ is defined on $\powerset{X}$ in
    the␣
    <a href='/sheets/event_probabilities.html'>
      ‖ the usual way ⦉
    </a>
    . ⦉

  ‖ Thus, the probabilistic model is $\Set{𝗣_θ}{θ ∈ [0,1]}$. ⦉

  ‖ Given $x$, we are asked to guess $θ$. ⦉

§ Decisions ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬decision procedure❭ (❬estimator❭, ❬statistical procedure❭)
    is a measurable function $A: 𝒳 → 𝒜$ where $𝒜$ is a a set,
    called the ❬actions❭ or ❬decisions❭. ⦉

  ‖ Often $𝒜 = Θ$, in which case $A(x)$ givens an ❬estimate❭
    of $θ$, which we denote $\hat{θ}(x)$. ⦉
⦉

§ Judging decisions ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given a ❬loss function❭ $L: 𝒜 × Θ → \Rbar$, the ❬risk❭ of
    $A$ is
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ R(A, θ) = 𝗘 L(A(x), θ). ⦉
