§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to talk about the size of a displacement.

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬norm❭ of a vector $x ∈ 𝗥^2$ is
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the norm of $x$ by $\norm{x}$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, $\norm{\cdot}: 𝗥^2 → 𝗥$ is a function from
    vectors in $𝗥^2$ to real numbers. ⦉

  ‖ The notation follows the notation of absolute value, the
    ‹magnitude› of a real number, and the double verticals remind
    us that $x$ is a vector. ⦉

  ‖ A warning: some authors write $\abs{x}$ for the norm of $x$
    when it is understood that $x ∈ 𝗥^2$. ⦉

%%%% MACROS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% use \norm{x} for |x| 11/05/2021 I changed this back to ||x||, since that is alsmost always what I want.
% use \norm* for autosizing delimiters

% use \normm{x} for ||x||
% use \normm* for autosizing delimiters
