\section*{Definition}

Given a set $A$ of a topological space, a point $x$ is said to be \t{in the closure of} $A$ if, for each neighborhood $N$ of $X$, $N \cap  A \neq \varnothing$.
The \t{closure} of $A$ is the set of such points.

\subsection*{Notation}

The closure of a set $A$ of a topological space is denoted $\bar{A}$.
Other notation includes $\cl(A)$.
