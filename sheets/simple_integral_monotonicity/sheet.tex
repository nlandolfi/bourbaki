    \section*{Why}


If one rectangle contains another rectangle, the area of the first should be larger than the area of the second.
Our definition of integral for simple functions carries this property.

    \section*{Result}


\begin{proposition}
The simple non-negative
integral operator
is monotone.

\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}Let $(X, \mathcal{A} , \mu )$
be a measure space.
Let $f, g \in \SimpleF_+(X)$
with $f \leq g$.
Then $f - g \in \SimpleF_+(X)$,
so
\[
\begin{aligned}
\int  g d\mu  &= \int (f + (g - f)) d\mu  \\
&\overset{(a)}{=} \int  f d\mu  + \int  (g - f) d\mu  \\
&\overset{(b)}{\geq} \int  f d \mu
\end{aligned}
\]
where (a) follows from
linearity
and (b) follows from
non-negativity; properties
of the non-negative simple
integral operator.
\end{proof}
