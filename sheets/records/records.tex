\ssection{Why}

We are interested in building predictors.
%for unpresumptive prelations.
We can record
precepts and postcepts, and use such a sequence
to build predictors.

\ssection{Definition}

A \ct{record sequence}{}
is a finite sequence of elements
from a set.
We call an element of the sequence
a \ct{record}{}.
We say that the record sequence
is \ct{in}{} the set. A record
is an element of the set.

A \ct{paired record sequence}{}
is a record sequence in the
product set of two sets. If the first set
is a set of precepts and the second set is
a set of postcepts,
we call the first element
in the pair the \ct{precept record}{}
and the second the \ct{postcept record}{}.

\ssection{Notation}

Let $\CU$ and $\CV$ be sets.
Let $(u^1, \dots, u^n)$ be a record sequence in $\CU$.
So, for $i = 1, \dots, n$, $u^i \in \CU$.
Similarly let $(v^1, \dots, v^n)$ be a record sequence in $\CV$.
So, for $i = 1, \dots, n$, $v^i \in \CV$.
Then $((u^1, v^1), \dots, (v^1, \dots, v^n))$
is a paired record sequence of precepts and postcepts.
