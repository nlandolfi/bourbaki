§ Discussion ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ By definition, given $S ⊂ 𝗥^n$, $f: S → 𝗥$ is convex
    means that the point
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ (1 - λ)(x μ) + λ(x, ν) = ((1-λ)x + λy, (1-λ)μ + λν ⦉
    ⦉
    belongs to $\epi f$ whenever $(x, μ)$ and $(y, ν)$ belong
    to $\epi f$ and $0 ≤ λ ≤ 1$. ⦉

  ‖ Said differently, we have $(1-λ)x + λy ∈ S$, and
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ f((1-λ)x + λy) ≤ (1-λ)μ + λν ⦉
    ⦉
    whenever $x ∈ S$, $y ∈ S$, $f(x) ≤ μ ∈ 𝗥$, and $f(y) ≤
    ν ∈ 𝗥$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Concave functions have a similar property, with the
    inequalities flipped, and affine functions satisfy with
    qualities. ⦉

  ‖ This shows that the functions $f: 𝗥^n → 𝗥$ we are calling
    affine coincide exactly with the affine transformations from
    $𝗥^n$ to $𝗥$. ⦉
