\ssection{Why}

We want to talk about which sets of points correspond to rectangles in the real plane.

\ssection{Definition}

A \t{rectangle} is the cartesian product of two intervals
We clarify in the case that the intervals are either closed or open.
In these cases we call it an \t{open rectangle} or a \t{closed rectangle}.
If both intervals are half-open on the left or right we call it a \t{left-open rectangle} or \t{right-open rectangle} respectively.

\ssection{Notation}

Let $\ci{x_1, x_2},\ci{y_1,y_2}\in\R^2$.
Then $\ci{x_1, x_2} \times \ci{y_1,y_2}$ is a closed rectangle.
