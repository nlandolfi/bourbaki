§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to talk about which sets of points correspond to
    rectangles in the real plane. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬rectangle❭ is the cartesian product of two intervals. ⦉

  ‖ We clarify in the case that the intervals are either closed
    or open. ⦉

  ‖ In these cases we call it an ❬open rectangle❭ or a ❬closed
    rectangle❭. ⦉

  ‖ If both intervals are half-open on the left or right we
    call it a ❬left-open rectangle❭ or ❬right-open rectangle❭
    respectively. ⦉
⦉

§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $\ci{x_1, x_2},\ci{y_1,y_2}∈𝗥^2$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $\ci{x_1, x_2} × \ci{y_1,y_2}$ is a closed rectangle. ⦉
