§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Is some scaled form of a differentiable function
    differentiable? ⦉
⦉

§ Result ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Suppose $I ⊂ 𝗥$ is an interval and $f: I → 𝗥$ is
    differentiable. ⦉

  ‖ Then given any real number $λ ∈ 𝗥$, the function $λg$ is
    a differentiable functions whose derivative is $λg'$. ⦉
