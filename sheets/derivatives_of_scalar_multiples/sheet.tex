\section*{Why}

Is some scaled form of a differentiable function differentiable?

\section*{Result}

\begin{proposition}
Suppose $I \subset \R $ is an interval and $f: I \to \R $ is differentiable.
Then given any real number $\lambda  \in \R $, the function $\lambda g$ is a differentiable functions whose derivative is $\lambda g'$.
\end{proposition}
