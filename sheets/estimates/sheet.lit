§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to guess uncertain outcomes. ⦉

  ‖ We model these uncertain outcomes as random variables. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $(Ω, 𝒜, 𝗣)$ is a probability space and $x: Ω → V$
    is a random variable. ⦉

  ‖ An ❬estimate❭ (or ❬prediction❭, ❬guess❭) for $x$ is a value
    $v ∈ V$. ⦉

  ‖ Some authors call the selection of an estimate ❬estimation❭
    or an ❬estimation problem❭. ⦉
⦉

§ Cost functions ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬cost function❭ for an estimate in $V$ is a function $C:
    V × V → 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ A cost function is also known as a ❬risk function❭. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬cost❭ of an estimate is itself a random variable $c:
    Ω → 𝗥$ which is $c(ω) = C(x(ω), ξ)$. ⦉
