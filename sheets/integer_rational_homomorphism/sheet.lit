§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Do the integer numbers correspond (in the sense of␣
    <a href='/sheets/homomorphisms.html'>
      ‖ Homomorphisms ⦉
    </a>
    ) to elements of the rationals. ⦉
⦉

§ Main result ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Indeed, roughly speaking the integers correspond to rationals
    whose denominator is 1. ⦉

  ‖ Define
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \tilde{Q} := \Set{\eqc{(a, b)} ∈ 𝗤}{b = 1_{𝗭}}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ The rings $(\tilde{𝗤}, +_{𝗤} |\tilde{𝗤}, ·_{𝗤} |\tilde{𝗤})$
    and $(Z, +_{𝗭}, ·_{𝗭})$ are homomorphic.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Indeed, more is true and will be included in future
        editions. There is an ‹order perserving› ring homomorphism. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
</statement>
<proof>
  ‖ The function is $f: 𝗭 → 𝗤$ with $f(z) = \eqc{(z, 1)}$.
