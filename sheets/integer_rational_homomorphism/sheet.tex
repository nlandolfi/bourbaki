\ssection{Why}

Do the integer numbers correspond (in the sense \sheetref{homomorphisms}{Homomorphisms}) to elements of the rationals.

\ssection{Main Result}

Indeed, roughly speaking the integers correspond to rationals whose denominator is 1.
Denote by $\tilde{\Q}$ the set $\Set{\eqc{(a, b)} \in Q}{b = 1_{\Z}}$.

\begin{proposition}
  The rings $(\tilde{\Q}, +_{\Q} \mid \tilde{\Q}, \cdot_{\Q} \mid \tilde{\Q})$ and $(Z, +_{\Z}, \cdot_{Z})$ are homomorphic.\footnote{Indeed, more is true and will be included in future editions. There is an \textit{order perserving} ring homomorphism.}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  The function is $f: \Z \to \Q$ with $f(z) = \eqc{(z, 1)}$.\footnote{The full account will appear in future editions.}
\end{proof}
