\s{Why}

We want notation for the Cartesian (direct) product of a sequence of sets

\s{Definition}

A \t{natural direct product} is the cartesian product of a sequence.

\ss{Notation}

Let $\set{A_i}$ be a sequence of sets.
If $\set{A_i}$ is finite and indexed by $n - \set{\emptyset{0}}$ we denote
the product of the sequence by
\[
  \product_{i = 1}^{n} A_i
\]
and if infinite, then by
\[
  \product_{i = 1}^{\infty} A_i.
\]
