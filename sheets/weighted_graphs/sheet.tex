\section*{Why}

Often the edges of some graph are associated with a particular cost, perhaps the cost of traversing that edge.

\section*{Definition}

\subsection*{Undirected form}

A \t{weighted undirected graph} is an ordered pair $((V, E),w)$ where $(V, E)$ is an undirected graph and $w: E \to \R $ is an \t{unordered weight function}.

\subsection*{Directed form}

A \t{weighted directed graph} is an ordered pair $((V, F),\omega )$ where $(V, E)$ is an digraph and $\omega : F \to \R $ is an \t{ordered weight function} (or \t{weight function}).
