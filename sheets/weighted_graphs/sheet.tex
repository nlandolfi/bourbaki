\section*{Why}

Often the edges of some graph are associated with a particular cost, perhaps the cost of traversing that edge.

\section*{Definition}

Let $(V, E)$ be an undirected graph.
An \t{unordered weight function} $w: E \to \R $ is a function mapping undirected edges to real numbers.
A \t{weighted undirected graph} is an ordered pair $((V, E),w)$ where $(V, E)$ is an undirected graph and $w$ is an unordered wieght function.

Let $(V, F)$ be a directed graph.
An \t{ordered weight function} or just \t{weight function} $\omega : F \to \R $ is a function mapping directed edges to real numbers.
A \t{weighted directed graph} is an ordered pair $((V, F),\omega )$ where $(V, E)$ is an undirected graph and $\omega $ is an ordered wieght function.
