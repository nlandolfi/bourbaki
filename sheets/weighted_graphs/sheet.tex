\ssection{Why}

Often the edges of some graph are associated with a particular cost, perhaps the cost of traversing that edge.

\ssection{Definition}

A weighted graph is an ordered pair: its first coordinate is a graph and its second coordinate is a function from the edge set of the graph to the real numbers.
We call the function the \t{weight function} and call the result of the function on the edge the \t{weight} of an edge.
