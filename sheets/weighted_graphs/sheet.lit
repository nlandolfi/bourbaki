§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Often the edges of some graph are associated with a
    particular cost, perhaps the cost of traversing that edge. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(V, E)$ be an undirected graph. ⦉

  ‖ An ❬unordered weight function❭ $w: E → 𝗥$ is a function
    mapping undirected edges to real numbers. ⦉

  ‖ A ❬weighted undirected graph❭ is an ordered pair $((V,
    E),w)$ where $(V, E)$ is an undirected graph and $w$ is an
    unordered wieght function. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(V, F)$ be a directed graph. ⦉

  ‖ An ❬ordered weight function❭ or just ❬weight function❭ $ω: F
    → 𝗥$ is a function mapping directed edges to real numbers. ⦉

  ‖ A ❬weighted directed graph❭ is an ordered pair $((V, F),ω)$
    where $(V, E)$ is an undirected graph and $ω$ is an ordered
    wieght function. ⦉
