§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Often the edges of some graph are associated with a
    particular cost, perhaps the cost of traversing that edge. ⦉

§ Definition ⦉

§§ Undirected form ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬weighted undirected graph❭ is an ordered pair $((V,
    E),w)$ where $(V, E)$ is an undirected graph and $w: E →
    𝗥$ is an ❬unordered weight function❭. ⦉
⦉

§§ Directed form ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬weighted directed graph❭ is an ordered pair $((V, F),ω)$
    where $(V, E)$ is an digraph and $ω: F → 𝗥$ is an
    ❬ordered weight function❭ (or ❬weight function❭). ⦉
