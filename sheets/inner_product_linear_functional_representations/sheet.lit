§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We can identify any linear functional $F: 𝗥^n → 𝗥$ with a
    vector $y ∈ 𝗥^n$ so that $F(x) = \ip{x,y}$. ⦉

  ‖ We generalize this result to complete inner product spaces. ⦉
⦉

§ Motivating result ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The following is known as the ❬Riesz representation theorem❭
    (or ❬Riesz-Fréchet representation theorem❭, or ❬Riesz theorem❭,
    or ❬Riesz-Fréchet theorem❭). ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Let $((V, k), \ip{·,·})$ be a complete inner product space
    and let $F: V → k$ be a continuous linear functional on
    $V$. ⦉

  ‖ There exists a unique $y ∈ V$ so that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ F(x) = \ip{x, y} ⦉
    ⦉

    ‖ for all $x ∈ V$. Moreover $\norm{y} = \dnorm{F}$. ⦉⦉
</statement>
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Clearly $𝗥^n$ is a complete inner product space, and so
    this this theorem says the expected. ⦉

  ‖ We can identify linear functionals on $𝗥^n$ with elements
    (vectors) in $𝗥^n$.
