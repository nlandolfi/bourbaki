§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ What are some simple functions? ⦉

  ‖ Here's one answer: those that only involve addition and
    multiplication.

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬real polynomial❭ (or ❬polynomial❭) of degree $d$ is a
    function $p: 𝗥 → 𝗥$ for which there exists a finite
    sequence $a = (a_0, a_1, …, a_d)$ so that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + ⋯ + a_nx^d. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ In particular, $q(x) = ax + b$ for $a, b ∈ 𝗥$ is a
    polynomial of the first degree and $r(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$
    for $a, b, c ∈ 𝗥$ is a polynomial of the second degree. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ In a sense, these are “simple” functions. ⦉

  ‖ We require addition (and substraction) and multiplication; but
    no division. ⦉

§ Properties ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Let $p: 𝗥 → 𝗥$ be a polynomial of degree $d$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $p$ is continuous. ⦉
</statement>
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Let $p: 𝗥 → 𝗥$ be a polynomial of degree $d$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $p$ has derivatives of all orders. ⦉

  ‖ Every derivative of $p$ is a polynomial. ⦉
</statement>
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Let $p: 𝗥 → 𝗥$ be a polynomial of degree $d$. ⦉

  ‖ The every derivative of order $d+1$ or greater is the
    constant 0 function. ⦉
