\section*{Why}

What are some simple functions?
Here's one answer: those that only involve addition and multiplication.

\section*{Definition}

A \t{real polynomial} (or \t{polynomial}) of degree $d$ is a function $p: \R  \to \R $ for which there exists a finite sequence $a = (a_0, a_1, \dots , a_d)$ so that
    \[
p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \cdots + a_nx^d.
    \]
In particular, $q(x) = ax + b$ for $a, b \in \R $ is a polynomial of the first degree and $r(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ for $a, b, c \in \R $ is a polynomial of the second degree.

In a sense, these are \say{simple} functions.
We require addition (and substraction) and multiplication; but no division.

\section*{Properties}

\begin{proposition}
Let $p: \R  \to \R $ be a polynomial of degree $d$.
Then $p$ is continuous.\end{proposition}
\begin{proposition}
Let $p: \R  \to \R $ be a polynomial of degree $d$.
Then $p$ has derivatives of all orders.
Every derivative of $p$ is a polynomial.\end{proposition}
\begin{proposition}
Let $p: \R  \to \R $ be a polynomial of degree $d$.
The every derivative of order $d+1$ or greater is the constant 0 function.\end{proposition}
