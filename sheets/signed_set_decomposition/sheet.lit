§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Are all signed measures ⦉

  ‖ the difference of two ⦉

  ‖ positive measures? ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose we could partition ⦉

  ‖ the base set into two ⦉

  ‖ sets, one containing ⦉

  ‖ all the sets with positive ⦉

  ‖ measure and one containing ⦉

  ‖ all sets with negative measure. ⦉

  ‖ We could restrict the measure to the former and it would
    be positive, and we could restrict it to the latter and it
    would be negative. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Any measurable set could be partitioned ⦉

  ‖ into a piece in the former and a ⦉

  ‖ piece in the latter, and so ⦉

  ‖ its signed measure could be ⦉

  ‖ written as a sum of measures ⦉

  ‖ of these pieces. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ By “positive” and “negative” we mean “non-negative” and
    “non-positive.” ⦉

  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜)$ be a measurable space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $μ: 𝒜 → \eri$ ⦉

  ‖ be a signed measure. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬positive set❭ ⦉

  ‖ is a measurable set ⦉

  ‖ with the property that ⦉

  ‖ each of its subsets have ⦉

  ‖ non-negative measure ⦉

  ‖ under $μ$. ⦉

  ‖ A ❬negative set❭ ⦉

  ‖ is a measurable set ⦉

  ‖ with the property that ⦉

  ‖ each of its subsets have ⦉

  ‖ non-positive measure ⦉

  ‖ under $μ$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬signed-set decomposition❭ ⦉

  ‖ of $X$ under $μ$ ⦉

  ‖ is a partition of $X$ ⦉

  ‖ into a positive and a negative set. ⦉

  ‖ Some authors call it a ⦉

  ‖ ❬Hahn decomposition❭. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Denote by $P$ a positive ⦉

  ‖ and by $N$ a negative set. ⦉

  ‖ When we say “let $(P, N)$ ⦉

  ‖ be a signed-set decomposition ⦉

  ‖ of $X$ under $μ$”, ⦉

  ‖ we mean that $P$ is ⦉

  ‖ the positive set and $N$ ⦉

  ‖ is the negative set. ⦉
⦉

§ Motivating implication ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Does such a decomposition ⦉

  ‖ always exist? Is it unique? ⦉

  ‖ We are motivated to find ⦉

  ‖ answers ⦉

  ‖ by the following observation. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose there was a signed-set ⦉

  ‖ decomposition of $(X, 𝒜)$ ⦉

  ‖ under $μ$; denote it by $(P, N)$. ⦉

  ‖ Then ⦉

  ‖ $μ(A ∩ P) ≥ 0$ ⦉

  ‖ and $μ(A ∩ N) ≤ 0$ ⦉

  ‖ for all $A ∈ 𝒜$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Define ⦉

  ‖ $μ_1 = μ(A ∩ P)$ ⦉

  ‖ and $μ_2 = -μ(A ∩ P)$, ⦉

  ‖ then $μ_1$ and $μ_2$ are finite measures. ⦉

  ‖ Moreover, $μ = μ_1 - μ_2$. ⦉

  ‖ Thus, if we had a signed-set decomposition ⦉

  ‖ we could write $μ$ as the difference ⦉

  ‖ of two measures. ⦉
