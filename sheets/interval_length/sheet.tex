\ssection{Why}

Toward defining the length
of a subset of real numbers,
we start by defining
the length of an interval.

\ssection{Definition}

The
\ct{length}{intervallength}
of an interval is the difference
of its endpoints: the larger less
the smaller.

\ssection{Notation}

Let $a, b$ be real numbers which
satisfy the relation $a < b$.
The length of $(a, b)$, $[a, b]$
$[a, b)$ and $(a, b]$ is, in each case, $b - a$.

For example, the length
of the interval $(0, 1)$ is one.
