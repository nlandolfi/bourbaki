\ssection{Why}

We want to talk about learning
associations between perceptions
in time or space.

\ssection{Definition}

Consider two sets
and a relation between them.
Consider a finite sequence of elements
from their product.
An \ct{inductor}{} is a function
from the set of finite sequences of
elements from the product of the two
sets to the set of functions from
the first set to the second set.

We call the first set the
\ct{precepts}{} and the second
set the
\ct{postcepts}{}.
We call the finite sequence of
elements the \ct{record sequence}{}
and an element of it a \ct{record}{}.
We call a function from the precepts
to the postcepts a \ct{predictor}{}.
We call the result of a precept
under a predictor a \ct{prediction}{}.

An \ct{inductor}{} is a function
from record sequences to the
set of predictors
