§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A subset $M ⊂ 𝗥^n$ is a ❬smooth manifold❭ of dimension $d$
    if for every $x ∈ M$, there exists a neighborhood $V$ of
    $x$ in $X$ that is diffeomorphic to an open subset $U$ of
    $𝗥^d$. ⦉

  ‖ In this case we say that the set is ❬locally diffeomorphic❭
    to $𝗥^d$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A diffeomorphism $φ: U → V$ is called a ❬parameterization❭
    of the neighborhood of $V$. ⦉

  <!-- Recall $V ⊂ X$ a neighborhood of $x$ means that there exists an open set in $V$ around $x$. -->

  ‖ Its inverse diffeomorphism $φ^{-1}$ is called a ❬coordinate
    system❭ (or system of ❬coordinates❭) on $V$. ⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the dimension of a manifold $M$ by $\dim M$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Submanifolds ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ If $X$ and $Z$ are both manifolds in $R^n$ and $Z ⊂ X$,
    then we call $Z$ a ❬submanifold❭ of $X$. ⦉

  ‖ In particular, $X$ is a submanifold of $R^n$. ⦉

  ‖ Any open set of a manifold $X$ is a submanifold $X$.
