§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $f: 𝗥^n → 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ Given $a ∈ 𝗥^n$ and $δ ∈ 𝗥^n$, if the limit
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \lim_{t → 0} \frac{f(a + tδ) - f(a)}{t} ⦉
    ⦉
    exists, then we say that $f$ is ❬differentiable at $a$ in
    the direction $x$❭. ⦉

  ‖ We call the value of the limit the ❬directional derivative❭
    of $f$ at $a$, in the direction $δ$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the directional derivative of $f$ at $a$ by $D_xf(x)$.⦉
