    ␣$A, B$ with $𝗣(A), 𝗣(B) > 0$, we have

    ⦉⦉
  <proof>
    ‖ By definition, we have
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ 𝗣(A | B) = \frac{ 𝗣(A ∩ B) }{ 𝗣(B) }. ⦉
      ⦉⦉

    ‖ And also symmetrically,
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ P(B | A) = \frac{ 𝗣(A ∩ B) }{ 𝗣(A) }. ⦉
      ⦉⦉

    ‖ From this second equation we have $𝗣(A ∩ B) = 𝗣(B | A)
      𝗣(A)$, which we can substitute into the numerator of the
      first expression to obtain the result. ⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ It is a ‹basic› consequence of the ‹definition› of
    conditional probability, but it is ‹useful› in the case that
    we are given problem data in terms of the probabilities on
    the right hand side of the above equation. ⦉
