\section*{Why}

Most games are iterative.\footnote{Future editions will expand.}

\subsection*{Example: tic-tac-toe}

Consider the game ``tic-tac-toe'' in which there are two players.
Denote the players by $X$ and $O$.
The game starts with an empty $3 \times 3$ array, which the players proceed to ``fill.''

Player $O$ starts and selects a cell in which to ``mark her move.''
From then on, that cell is ``occupied,''
Second, it is player $X$'s turn to pick a cell, any one that is not already occupied.
The play proceeds until either all cells are occupied or one of the player has three cells in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
