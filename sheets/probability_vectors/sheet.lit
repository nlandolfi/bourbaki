§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We can identify probability distributions with vectors. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $p: Ω → 𝗥$ be a probability distribution on a finite
    set $Ω = \set{ω_1, …, ω_n}$. ⦉

  ‖ We can associate $p$ with the vector $x ∈ 𝗥^n$ defined by
    $x_i = p(ω_i)$ for $i = 1, …, n$. ⦉

  ‖ We call this vector $y$ the ❬probability vector❭ associated
    with $p$. ⦉

  ‖ The conditions on $p$ mean that (1) $\ip{1, y} = 1$ and
    (2) $y ≥ 0$ (i.e., $y_i ≥ 0$ for all $i = 1, …, n$.). ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Conversely, suppose $z ∈ 𝗥$ satifies (1) and (2). ⦉

  ‖ Then $q: Ω → 𝗥$ defined by $q(ω_i) = z_i$ for $i = 1,
    …, n$ is a probability distribution. ⦉

  ‖ For this reason, we call $z$ satisfying the conditions a
    ❬distribution vector❭. ⦉

  ‖ Notice that implicit in this correspondence is a numbering
    $ω: \set{1, …, n} → Ω$ of the set of outcomes $Ω$. ⦉
⦉

§ Expectation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $ρ ∈ 𝗥^n$ is a distribution vector corresponding to
    $p: Ω → 𝗥$ its corresponding distribution. ⦉

  ‖ Let $x: Ω → 𝗥$ and (similar to $ρ$) define $ξ ∈ 𝗥^n$ by
    $ξ_i = x(ω_i)$ for $i = 1, …, n$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $𝗘x = \ip{ρ, ξ}$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Example ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ For $ρ = (-1, -1, 1, 1, 2)$ and $ξ = (0.1, 0.15, 0.1,
    0.25, 0.4)$
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ 𝗘x = \ip{ρ, ξ} -1 -0.15 + 0.1 + 0.25 + 2(0.4) = 0.9. ⦉
