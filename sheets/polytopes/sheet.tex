\ssection{Definition}

A \t{polytope} is the convex hull of a set if finitely many points.

An \t{$m$-dimensional simplex} is the convex hull of $m+1$ affinely independent points; an $m$-dimensional simplex is a polytope.
The points are called the \t{vertices} of the simplex.

When $m = 0, 1, 2, 3$ the simplex is a \t{point}, \t{closed line segment}, \t{triangle} or \t{tetrahedron}.
