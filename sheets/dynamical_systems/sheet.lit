§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to model natural phenomena.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will modify, and may develop dynamic
        systems via the genetic approach by appealing to their
        classical use in Newtonian physics for modeling celestial
        mechanics. ⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $X_0, X_1, …, X_T$ be a sequence of sets and let
    $f_t: X_t → X_{t+1}$ for $t = 0, …, T-1$. ⦉

  ‖ We call $((X_0, …, X_T), (f_1, …, f_{T-1}$ a ❬deterministic
    discrete-time dynamical system❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We call the index $t$ the ❬epoch❭, the ❬stage❭ or the
    ❬period❭. ⦉

  ‖ We call $X_t$ the ❬state space❭ at period $t$. ⦉

  ‖ We call $f_t$ the ❬transition function❭ or ❬dynamics
    function❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $x_0 ∈ 𝗖X_0$. Define a state sequence $x_1 ∈ 𝗖X_1, …,
    x_T ∈ 𝗖X_T$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ x_{t+1} = f_t(x_t, u_t). ⦉
    ⦉

    ‖ In this case we call $x_0$ the ❬initial state❭. ⦉

    ‖ We call the $x_t$ the ❬trajectory❭ associatd with initial
      state $x_0$. ⦉⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We call $T$ the ❬horizon❭. ⦉

  ‖ In the case that we have an infinite sequence of state
    sets, input sets, and dynamics, then we refer to a
    ❬infinite-horizon❭ dynamical system. ⦉

  ‖ To use language in contrast with this case, we refer to
    the dynamical system when $T$ is finite as a ❬finite-horizon❭
    dynamical system. ⦉
