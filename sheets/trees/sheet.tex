An undirected graph is a \t{tree} if it is connected and acyclic.
An undirected graph is a \t{forest} if it is acyclic.
Each connected component of a forest is a tree, motivating the definition.

%% TODO: sheet on connected graphs? move this reasoning there?
%%Let $T = (V, E)$ be a tree, a mnemonic for \say{tree.}
%% Let $V$ be the vertex set associated with $T$.
%% In other words, $$V = \union_{e \in T} e$$.
%% Let $E$ be so that $(u, v) \in E$ if and only if $\set{u, v} \in T$ for every $u, v \in V$.
%% By construction, the graph $(V, E)$ is undirected.
%% $T$ a tree means $(V, E)$ is connected and acyclic.
%%
%% A major motivator for our definition of trees is so that we can write $\set{u, v} \in T$. TODO
%% Since the graph $(V, E)$ is undirected, it must be the case that $(u, v) \in E$ if and only if $(v, u) \in E$ for $u, v \in V$.
%% Using this and that $(V, E)$ is connected, we conclude that for each $v \in V$ there exists $e \in E$ such that $v$ is the first coordinate of $e$.
%% So then, if we unite the first coordinates of elements of $E$ we obtain the vertex set.
%% Thus, from the edge set we know the vertex set.
%%
%% In the case of trees, use the letter $T$ for the edge set (a mnemonic for \say{tree}).
%% We say \say{let $T$ be a tree} to mean that \say{let $(V, T)$ be a tree where $V$ is the vertex set given by the set of edges $T$.}
%% As usual, if $u T v$ then $\op{u, v} \in T$.
%% So $\op{u, v} \in T$ is a shorthand for \say{$\op{u, v}$ is an edge of $T$.}

\section*{Properties}

\begin{proposition}
There is a unique path between any two vertices of a tree.
\begin{proof}Such a path exists because the tree is connected.
Such a path is unique because the existence of two separate paths would create a cycle.\end{proof}
\end{proposition}

\subsection*{Distance}

The \t{distance} between two vertices $v$ and $w$ in a tree is the length of the unique path connnecting $v$ and $w$.
Recall that the length of a path is the number of edges, or one fewer than the number of vertices.
If $v$ and $w$ are adjacent in the tree, then there distance is 1.
