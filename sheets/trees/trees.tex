\stitle{Trees}

\ssection{Why}

Tree branches split
and do not recombine.
We formalize this
property in the
language of graphs.

\ssection{Definition}

A
\ct{tree}{tree}
is a
connected
acyclic graph.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(V, E)$ be a tree.
When the vertex set is clear
from context, we use
use $T$, a mnemonic for \say{tree,}
to denote the edge set.
We denote the set of trees
on the vertex set $V$ by
$T(V)$.

\ssection{Properties}

\begin{prop}
  In any tree,
  there is only one
  path between
  any two vertices.

\begin{proof}
  Suppose to the contrary that
  there were two paths from
  vertex $u$ to vertex $v$,
  then by combining these paths
  we obtain a cycle. But the
  tree has no cycles,
  so there must not be two paths
  between any two vertices.
\end{proof}
\end{prop}
