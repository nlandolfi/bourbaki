  ‖ \ssection{Definition} ⦉

  ‖ A function $f: 𝗥^n → 𝗥^m$ is ❬linear❭ if
    𝍫 ⦊
      ‣ $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)$ for all $x, y ∈ 𝗥^n$ and ⦉

      ‣ $f(α x) = α f(x)$ for all $x ∈ 𝗥^n$ and $α ∈ 𝗥$. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ There are simple consequences to these conditions. ⦉

  ‖ For example, $f(0) =0$. ⦉

  ‖ For reasons which may be clarified in future editions, these
    conditions are sometimes described as ❬superposition❭. ⦉
