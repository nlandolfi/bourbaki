§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $z_1, z_2 ∈ 𝗖$ with $z_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $z_2 =
    (x_2, y_2)$. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬complex product❭ of $z_1$ and $z_2$ is the complex
    number
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ (x_1x_2 - y_1y_2, x_1y_2 + y_1x_2). ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the complex product of $z_1$ and $z_2$ by $z_1 ·
    z_2$ or $z_1z_2$. ⦉
    ⦉ ¶ ⦊ 

  ‖ The notation overloads that used for real numbers. ⦉

  ‖ This overloading is justified by the fact that the complex
    product of two purely real complex numbers $z_1$ and $z_2$
    the purely real complex number whose real part is the
    product of the real parts of $z_1$ and $z_2$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Recall that we denote $z_1 = x_1 + iy_1$ and $z_2 = x_2
    + iy_2$. ⦉

  ‖ This notation is a mnemonic for the definition of a complex
    product if we treat $i^2 = -1$.
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \begin{aligned} ⦉

      ‖ z_1z_2 ❲&❳= (x_1 + iy_1)(x_2 + iy_2) ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ ❲&❳= x_1x_2 + ix_1y_2 + iy_1x_2 + i^2 y_1y_2 ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ ❲&❳= (x_1x_2 - y_1y_2) + i(x_1y_2 + y_1x_2). ⦉

§ Properties ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ \begin{proposition}[Commutativity] ⦉

  ‖ For all $z_1, z_2 ∈ 𝗖$, we have $z_1z_2 = z_2z_1$. ⦉

  ‖ \end{proposition} ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ \begin{proposition}[Associativity] ⦉

  ‖ For all $z_1, z_2, z_3 ∈ 𝗖$, we have ⦉

  ‖ and $z_1(z_2z_3) = (z_1z_2)z_3$. ⦉

  ‖ \end{proposition} ⦉
⦉

§ Complex multiplication ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We call the operation that associates a pair of complex
    numbers with their product ❬complex multiplication❭. ⦉

  ‖ The operation is symmetric (commutative). ⦉
⦉

§ Multiplicative identity and inverse ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Notice that the complex number $(1, 0)$ is the
    multiplicative identity. ⦉

  ‖ It is unique,
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will include an account ⦉
    ⦉
    and so we call it the ❬complex multiplicative identity.❭ ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We call the operation $(z, w) ↦ z∕w$ ❬complex division❭ and
    we call $z∕w$ the ❬(complex) quotient❭ of $z$ with $w$. ⦉
