§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want sums to follow those of natural numbers.

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Consider $\eqc{(a, b)}, \eqc{(c, d)} ∈ 𝗭$. ⦉

  ‖ We define the ❬integer sum❭ of $\eqc{(a, b)}$ with $\eqc{(c,
    d)}$ as $\eqc{(a + c, b + d)}$.
    † ⦊
      ‖ One needs to show that this is well-defined. The account
        will appear in future editions. ⦉

§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the sum of $\eqc{(a, b)}$ and $\eqc{(c, d)}$ by
    $\eqc{(a, b)} + \eqc{(b, c)}$ ⦉

  ‖ So if $x, y ∈ 𝗭$ then the sum of $x$ and $y$ is $x +
    y$. ⦉
