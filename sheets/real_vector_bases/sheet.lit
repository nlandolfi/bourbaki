§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A set of vectors $\set{v_1, …, v_k}$ is a ❬basis❭ for a
    subspace $S ⊂ 𝗥^n$ if
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ S = \span\set{v_1, …, v_k} \quad \text{ and } \quad
        \set{v_1, …, v_k} \text{ is independent. } ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ This definition captures two competing properties. ⦉

  ‖ The first is that the set is large, in the sense that any
    vector in $S$ can be represented as a linear combination of
    vectors in $\set{v_1, …, v_k}$. ⦉

  ‖ Simultaneously, the set is small, in the sense that no
    vector in the set is a linear combination of the others. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, there is no extra vector in the set. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Linear independence is equivalent to uniqueness of
    representation of the vectors representable as a linear
    combination of $v_1, …, v_k$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, $\set{v_1, …, v_k}$ is a basis for $S$ if
    each vector $x ∈ S$ can be uniquely expressed as
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ x = α_1 v_1 + ⋯ + α_k v_k. ⦉
