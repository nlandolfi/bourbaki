§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Can we order the cone of positive semidefinite matrices? ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬positive semidefinite matrix order❭ (or ❬Loewner order❭)
    is a partial ordering $≥$ on $𝗦^d$ defined by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ A ≥ B \quad \iff \quad A - B ≥ 0 \quad \iff \quad A
        - B ∈ 𝗦_+^d. ⦉
    ⦉

    ‖ We define the partial order $>$ on symmetric matrices by
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ A > B \quad \iff \quad A - B > 0 \quad \iff \quad
          A - B ∈ 𝗦_{++}^d. ⦉

§ Properties ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Each of the following results from the geometric properties
    of the positive semidefinite cone:
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \begin{aligned} ⦉

      ‖ α A ≥ 0 \quad ❲&❳ \text{ for all } δ > 0, A ≥ 0, ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ A + B ≥ 0 \quad ❲&❳ \text{ for all } A, B ≥ 0, ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ A ≥ B \text{ and } B ≥ A ⟹ A = B \quad ❲&❳ \text{
        for all } A, B ∈ 𝗦^d, ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ \lim_{n → ∞} A_n = A ⟹ A ≥ 0 \quad ❲&❳ \text{ for
        all sequences } (A_n)_n \text{ in } 𝗦_+^d. ⦉

      ‖ \end{aligned} ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

§ Partial Order ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ $A ≥ B$ and $B ≥ A$ giving $A = B$ means that $≥$ is
    antisymmetric. ⦉

  ‖ Moreover,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \begin{aligned} ⦉

      ‖ A ≥ A \quad & \text{ for all } A ∈ 𝗦^d, \text{ and
        } ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ A ≥ B \text{ and } B ≥ C ⟹ A ≥ C & \text { for
        all } A, B, C ∈ 𝗦^d. ⦉

      ‖ \end{aligned} ⦉
    ⦉

    ‖ In other words, $≥$ is also reflexive and transitive. ⦉

    ‖ In other words, $≥$ is a partial order (see
      \sheetref{partial_orders}{Partial Orders}).
      † ⦊
        ‖ Future editions will include more formal accounts. ⦉
      ⦉⦉⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ For $d = 1$, $≥$ reduces to the familiar total order of
    the real line(see \sheetref{real_order}{Real Order}). ⦉

  ‖ The converse perspective is to see the positive semidefinite
    order as an extension of the order on $𝗥$ to the space
    $𝗦^d$. ⦉

  ‖ Of course, the key difference is that two matrices may not
    be comparable. ⦉

  ‖ The order is ‹partial›. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ For example, the matrices $A, B ∈ 𝗦^2$ defined by ⦉
  ◇ ⦊
    ‖ A = \bmat{ ⦉

    ‖ 1 ❲&❳ 0 ᜶ ⦉

    ‖ 0 ❲&❳ 0 ⦉

    ‖ }, ⦉

    ‖ \quad ⦉

    ‖ B = \bmat{ ⦉

    ‖ 0 ❲&❳ 0 ᜶ ⦉

    ‖ 0 ❲&❳ 1 ⦉

    ‖ } ⦉
  ⦉

  ‖ are not comparable. ⦉

  ‖ Neither $A ≥ B$ nor $B ≥ A$ holds. ⦉
