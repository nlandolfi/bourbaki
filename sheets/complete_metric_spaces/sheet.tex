%!need:egoprox_sequences

\ssection{Why}

We want our spaces to be analytically complete.\footnote{Future editions will modify.}

\ssection{Definition}

Our model for completeness is the real numbers, which are (by definition) complete.
A metric space is \t{complete} if every egoprox sequence converges.
