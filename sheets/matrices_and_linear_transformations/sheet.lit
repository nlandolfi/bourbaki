§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ All linear transformations are equivalent to multiplication by
    a matrix. ⦉
⦉

§ Main result ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Let $(V_1, 𝗙), (V_2, 𝗙)$ be two vector spaces and $f:
      V_1 → V_2$ be a transformation between them. ⦉
  ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ If $f$ is linear, then there exists bases for the spaces
      and a matrix $A$ in $𝗙$ for which matrix multiplication is
      equivalent to applying $f$. ⦉
  ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ If $A$ is a matrix in $F$ $f$ is linear if and only if
      there exists a matrix in $𝗙$ whose coordinates in $V_1$ to
      coordinates in $V_2$. ⦉
