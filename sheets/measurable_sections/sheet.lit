§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Toward a theory ⦉

  ‖ of iterated integrals, ⦉

  ‖ we need to know that ⦉

  ‖ set and function sections ⦉

  ‖ are measurable. ⦉
⦉

§ Results ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜)$ and $(Y, ℬ)$ be measurable spaces. ⦉

    ‖ For any $E ∈ 𝒜 × ℬ$, the sections $E_x$ and $E^y$ are
      measurable for any $x ∈ X$ and $y ∈ Y$. ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜)$ and $(Y, ℬ)$ be measurable spaces. ⦉

    ‖ Let $f: X × Y → F$, ⦉

    ‖ where $F$ is the extended real ⦉

    ‖ numnbers or the complex numbers, ⦉

    ‖ and $f$ is measurable (using ⦉

    ‖ the appropriate sigma algebra of ⦉

    ‖ the codomain). ⦉

    ‖ The sections ⦉

    ‖ $f_x: Y → F$ ⦉

    ‖ and ⦉

    ‖ $f^y: X → F$ are measurable ⦉

    ‖ for each $x ∈ X$ and $y ∈ Y$. ⦉
