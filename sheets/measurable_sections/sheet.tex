\section*{Why}

Toward a theory
of iterated integrals,
we need to know that
set and function sections
are measurable.

\section*{Results}

\begin{proposition}
Let $(X, \mathcal{A} )$ and $(Y, \mathcal{B} )$ be measurable spaces.
For any $E \in \mathcal{A}  \times  \mathcal{B} $, the sections $E_x$ and $E^y$ are measurable for any $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$.

\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
Let $(X, \mathcal{A} )$ and $(Y, \mathcal{B} )$ be measurable spaces.
Let $f: X \times  Y \to F$,
where $F$ is the extended real
numnbers or the complex numbers,
and $f$ is measurable (using
the appropriate sigma algebra of
the codomain).
The sections
$f_x: Y \to F$
and
$f^y: X \to F$ are measurable
for each $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$.

\end{proposition}
