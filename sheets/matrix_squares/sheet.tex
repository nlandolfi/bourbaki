\ssection{Why}\footnote{Future editions will include an account.}

\ssection{Definition}

The \t{square} of a square matrix is the product of the matrix with itself.
A \t{square root} (or \t{matrix square root}) of a given matrix is a matrix whose square is the given matrix.
A matrix is \t{idempotent} if it is equal to its square.


\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $A \in \R^{n \times n}$.
Then the square of $A$ is $AA$.
We denote the square of $A$ by $A^2$.
$A$ is idempotent if $A^2 = A$.
$B \in \R^{n \times n}$ is a square root of $A$ if $A = B^2$.

\ssection{Existence and uniqueness}

Clearly a matrix can have a square root.
Take for example the matrix in $\R^{1 \times 1}$ $\bmat{1}$.
A square root of this matrix is $\pmat{1}$, but also $\pmat{-1}$.
So matrix square roots do exist, but are not unique.
