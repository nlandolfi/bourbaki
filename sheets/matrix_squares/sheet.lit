§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬square❭ of a square matrix is the product of the
    matrix with itself. ⦉

  ‖ A ❬square root❭ (or ❬matrix square root❭) of a given matrix
    is a matrix whose square is the given matrix. ⦉

  ‖ A matrix is ❬idempotent❭ if it is equal to its square. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A ∈ 𝗥^{n × n}$. ⦉

  ‖ Then the square of $A$ is $AA$. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the square of $A$ by $A^2$. ⦉

  ‖ $A$ is idempotent if $A^2 = A$. ⦉

  ‖ $B ∈ 𝗥^{n × n}$ is a square root of $A$ if $A = B^2$. ⦉
⦉

§ Existence and uniqueness ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Clearly a matrix can have a square root. ⦉

  ‖ Take for example the matrix in $𝗥^{1 × 1}$ which is
    $\bmat{1}$. ⦉

  ‖ A square root of this matrix is $\bmat{1}$, but also
    $\bmat{-1}$. ⦉

  ‖ So matrix square roots do exist, but are not unique. ⦉
