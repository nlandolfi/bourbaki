§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬line through❭ two points in $n$-dimensional space is
    the set of points which can be expressed as the sum of the
    first point and a scaled multiple of the difference between
    the second point and the first. ⦉

  ‖ An ❬affine set❭ is a subset of $n$-dimensional space which
    contains the lines through each of its points. ⦉
⦉

§§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The empty set is trivially an affine set. ⦉

  ‖ The entire set of points in $n$-dimensional space is an
    affine set. ⦉

  ‖ Any singleton is an affine set. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬line through❭ two points $x$ and $y$ in $𝗥^n$ is the
    set
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \Set*{x + a(y - x)}{a ∈ 𝗥 \text{ and } x, y ∈ 𝗥^n}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Notice that the expression $x + a(y - x)$ is equivalent to
    $(1 - a)x + ay$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Other terminology ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Some authors call affine sets ❬affine varieties❭, ❬linear
    varieties❭ or ❬flat❭. ⦉
