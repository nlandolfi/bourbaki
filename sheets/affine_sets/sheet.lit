§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ An ❬affine set❭ is a subset of $n$-dimensional space which
    contains the lines through each of its points. ⦉
⦉

§§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The empty set is trivially an affine set. ⦉

  ‖ The entire set of points in $n$-dimensional space is an
    affine set. ⦉

  ‖ Any singleton is an affine set. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ As usual, let $L(x, y)$ denote the line between $x, y ∈
    𝗥^n$. ⦉

  ‖ The set $A$ is affine if $L(a, b) ⊂ A$ for all $a, b ∈
    A$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Other terminology ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Some authors call affine sets ❬affine varieties❭, ❬linear
    varieties❭ or ❬flat❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ \begin{proposition} ⦉

  ‖ The intersection of a family of affine sets is affine. ⦉
