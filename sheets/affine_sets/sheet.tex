\ssection{Why}

\ssection{Definition}

The \t{line through} two points in $n$-dimensional space is the set of points which can be expressed as the sum of the first point and a scaled multiple of the difference between the second point and the first.
An \t{affine set} is a subset of $n$-dimensional space which contains the lines through each of its points.

\ssubsection{Examples}

The empty set is trivially an affine set.
The entire set of points in $n$-dimensional space is an affine set.
Any singleton is an affine set.

\ssubsection{Notation}

The \t{line through} two points $x$ and $y$ in $\R^n$ is the set
$$
  \Set*{x + a(y - x)}{a \in \R \text{ and } x, y \in \R^n}.
$$
Notice that the expression $x + a(y - x)$ is equivalent to $(1 - a)x + ay$.

\ssubsection{Other Terminology}

Some authors call affine sets \t{affine varieties}, \t{linear varieties} or \t{flat}.
