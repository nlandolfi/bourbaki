\section*{Definition}

An \t{affine set} is a subset of $n$-dimensional space which contains the lines through each of its points.

\subsection*{Examples}

The empty set is trivially an affine set.
The entire set of points in $n$-dimensional space is an affine set.
Any singleton is an affine set.

\subsection*{Notation}

As usual, let $L(x, y)$ denote the line between $x, y \in \R ^n$.
The set $A$ is affine if $L(a, b) \subset A$ for all $a, b \in A$.

\subsection*{Other terminology}

Some authors call affine sets \t{affine varieties}, \t{linear varieties} or \t{flat}.

\begin{proposition}
The intersection of a family of affine sets is affine.
\end{proposition}
