\ssection{Definition}

A \t{convex} real-valued function is a function defined on a convex set of real numbers for which the result of the function on a convex combination of any two points in the domain is smaller than the convex combination of the same length of the value of the function on the endpoints.
  \ifhmode\unskip\fi\footnote{
Future editions will include figures
  }
A function $f: \R  \to \R $ is \t{concave} if the function $-f$ is convex.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $A \subset \R $ be a convex set.
The function $f: A \to \R $ is convex if, for any $a, b \in A$ and $t \in [0, 1]$,
  \[
f(ta + (1-t)b) \leq tf(a) + (1-t)f(b).
  \]
