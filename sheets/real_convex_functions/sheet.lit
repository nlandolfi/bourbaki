§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $X ⊂ 𝗥$ is a convex set. ⦉

  ‖ A function $f: X → 𝗥$ is ❬convex❭ if
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ f(tx + (1-t)y) ≤ tf(x) + (1-t)f(y) ⦉
    ⦉
    for all $y ∈ [0,1]$ and $x, y ∈ X$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ In other words, a real-valued function is a function defined
    on a convex set of real numbers for which the result of
    the function on a convex combination of any two points in
    the domain is smaller than the convex combination of the
    same length of the value of the function on the endpoints. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ $f$ is ❬concave❭ if $-f$ is convex. ⦉
