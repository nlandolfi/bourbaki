⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬convex❭ real-valued function is a function defined on a
    convex set of real numbers for which the result of the
    function on a convex combination of any two points in the
    domain is smaller than the convex combination of the same
    length of the value of the function on the endpoints.

  ‖ A function $f: 𝗥 → 𝗥$ is ❬concave❭ if the function $-f$
    is convex. ⦉
