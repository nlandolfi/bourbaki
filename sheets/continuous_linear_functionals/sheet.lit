§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We can characterize the continuous linear functionals. ⦉
⦉

§ Main result ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Let $F$ be a linear functional on a normed space $(V,
    \norm{·})$. The following are equivalent:
    𝍫 ⦊
      ‣ $F$ is continuous; ⦉

      ‣ $F$ is continuous at 0; ⦉

      ‣ $\sup_{\norm{x} ≤ 1}\set{\abs{F(x)}} < ∈fty$.

  ‖ For this reason we often call ❬continuous linear functionals❭
    the ❬bounded linear functionals❭ or call them ❬continuous
    bounded linear functionals❭. ⦉
