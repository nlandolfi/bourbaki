\section*{Why}

We can characterize the continuous linear functionals.

\section*{Main result}

\begin{proposition}
Let $F$ be a linear functional on a normed space $(V, \norm{\cdot })$. The following are equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $F$ is continuous;
    \item $F$ is continuous at 0;
    \item $\sup_{\norm{x} \leq 1}\set{\abs{F(x)}} < \infty$.\footnote{Future editions will include an account, and that will fill out this sheet.}
  \end{enumerate}
For this reason we often call \t{continuous linear functionals} the \t{bounded linear functionals} or call them \t{continuous bounded linear functionals}.\end{proposition}
