\section*{Why}

We want to generalize operations beyond two objects.

\section*{Operations}

The \t{pairwise extension} of a commutative operation is the function from
finite families of the ground set to the ground setobtained by
applying the operation pairwise to elements.
TODO: this is not a function if the operation is
not commutative.

The \t{ordered pairwise extension}
of an operation is the function from finite families
ground set to the
ground set obtained by
applying the operation pairwise to elements in order.

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $(A, +)$ be an algebra and
$\set{A_{i}}_{i=1}^{n}$ a finite family
of elements of $A$. We denote the pairwise
extension by
\[
\overset{n}{\underset{i=1}{+}} A_i
\]
