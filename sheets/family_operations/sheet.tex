\ssection{Why}

We want to generalize operations beyond
two objects.

\ssection{Operations}

The \ct{pairwise extension}{pairwiseextension}
of a commutative operation is the function from
finite families of the \rt{ground set}{groundset}
to the \rt{ground set}{groundset} obtained by
applying the operation pairwise to elements.
TODO: this is not a function if the operation is
not commutative.

The \ct{ordered pairwise extension}{orderedpairwiseextension}
of an operation is the function from finite families
\rt{ground set}{groundset} to the
\rt{ground set}{groundset} obtained by
applying the operation pairwise to elements in order.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(A, +)$ be an \rt{algebra}{algebra} and
$\set{A_{i}}_{i=1}^{n}$ a finite family
of elements of $A$. We denote the pairwise
extension by
\[
  \overset{n}{\underset{i=1}{+}} A_i
\]
