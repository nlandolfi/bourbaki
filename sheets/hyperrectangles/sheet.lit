§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to generalize rectangles and cubes to $n$-dimensional
    space. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $I: \upto{d} → 𝗥$ be a family of $d$ intervals. ⦉

  ‖ A ❬hyperrectangle❭ is the set $∏_{i=1}^{d} I_i$.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Some authors use the term rectangle or ❬$n$-dimensional
        rectangle❭. ⦉

      ‖ Some authors use the term ❬box❭ or ❬$n$-box❭. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ As a result of this definition, an interval, a rectangle,
    and a cube are all hyperrectangles. ⦉

  ‖ Of course, in our definition we include four, five, and
    “dimensional” rectangles. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ As with intervals, rectangles, and cubes, we call a
    hyperrectangle open, closed, left-open, right-open accordingly. ⦉
