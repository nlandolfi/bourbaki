\ssection{Why}

We want to generalize rectangles and cubes to $n$-dimensional space.

\ssection{Definition}
Let $I: \upto{d} \to \R$ be a family of $d$ intervals.
A \t{hyperrectangle} is the set $\prod_{i=1}^{d} I_i$.\footnote{Some authors use the term rectangle or \t{$n$-dimensional rectangle}. Some authors use the term \t{box} or \t{$n$-box}.}

As a result of this definition, an interval, a rectangle, and a cube are all hyperrectangles.
Of course, in our definition we include four, five, and \say{dimensional} rectangles.

As with intervals, rectangles, and cubes, we call a hyperrectangle open, closed, left-open, right-open accordingly.
