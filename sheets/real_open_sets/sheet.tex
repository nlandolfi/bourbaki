\ssection{Why}

In order to speak of the derivative of a function $f: (a, b) \to \R$ at some point $x_0 \in \R$, we took a limit of deviations from that point.
In other words,

\ssection{Definition}


A subset $U \subset \R^n$ is \t{open} if for every point $x \in U$ there exists a real number $\epsilon > 0$ so that $B(x, \epsilon) \subset U$.
