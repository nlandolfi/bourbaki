\ssection{Definition}

A \t{linear combination} is a sequence of vectors and a sequence of scalars from a vector space.
The \t{result of a linear combination} is the result of scaling the $i$th vector by the $i$th scalar and adding the results.

A \t{trivial linear combination} is one whose sequence of scalars is zero at each coordinate.
A \t{nontrivial linear combination} is one which is not trivial: in other words, there exists on coordinate of its scalar sequence which is nonzero.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(V, \F)$ be a vector space.
Let $v = (v_1, \dots, v_n)$ be a sequence of vectors in $V$.
Let $a = (a_1, \dots, a_n)$ be a sequence of scalars in $\F$.
Then $(v, a)$ is a linear combination and we can express its result by
$$
  a_1v_1 + a_2v_2 + \cdots + a_n v_n.
