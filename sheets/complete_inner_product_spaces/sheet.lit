§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝗙)$ be a vector space where $𝗙$ is $𝗥$ or $𝗖$. ⦉

  ‖ An inner product $\ip{·,·}: X × X → 𝗥$ induces a norm
    $\norm{·}: X → 𝗥$ defined by $\norm{x} = √{\ip{x,x}}$ and
    metric $d: X × X → 𝗥$ defined by $d(x, y) = \norm{x -
    y}$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ If $(X, d)$ is a complete metric space, we call $((X, 𝗙),
    \ip{·,·})$ a ❬complete inner product space❭ (or ❬Hilbert
    space❭).
    † ⦊
      ‖ The term Hilbert space is universal, but in accordance
        with the Bourbaki project’s guidelines on naming, we will
        tend to use the term complete inner product space, even
        though this is longer. ⦉
