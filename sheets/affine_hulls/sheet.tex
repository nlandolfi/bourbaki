\section*{Definition}

The \t{affine hull} of a set in $n$-dimensional space is the intersection of the collection of affine sets which contain it.

\subsection*{Notation}

We denote the affine hull of $S$ by $\aff S$.

\begin{proposition}The affine hull of $S \subset \R ^n$ consists of all vectors which can be expressed as
\[
\lambda \_1 x\_1 + \lambda \_2 x\_2 \cdots + \lambda \_m x\_m
\]
such that $x\_i \in S$ and $\sum\_i \lambda \_i = 1$.\end{proposition}
