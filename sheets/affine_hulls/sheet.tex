\ssection{Definition}

The \t{affine hull} of a set in $n$-dimensional space is the intersection of the collection of affine sets which contain it.

\ssubsection{Notation}

We denote the affine hull of $S$ by $\aff S$.

\begin{prop}
The affine hull of $S \subset \R ^n$ consists of all vectors which can be expressed as
  \[
\lambda _1 x_1 + \lambda _2 x_2 \cdots + \lambda _m x_m
  \]
such that $x_i \in S$ and $\sum_i \lambda _i = 1$.
\end{prop}
