\ssection{Why}

\ssection{Definition}

The \t{affine hull} of a set in $n$-dimensional space is the intersection of the collection of affine sets which contain it.

\ssubsection{Notation}

We denote the affine hull of $S$ by $\aff s$.

\begin{prop}
  The affine hull of $S \subset \R^n$ consists of all vectors which can be expressed as
  $$
    \lambda_1 x_1 + \lambda_2 x_2 \cdots + \lambda_m x_m
  $$
  such that $x_i \in S$ and $\sum_i \lambda_i = 1$.
\end{prop}
