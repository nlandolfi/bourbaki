\ssection{Why}

\ssection{Problem}

Tree-structured density
approximation is an
optimization problem in which we
select a tree-structured density
minimizing differential entropy
relative to a given density over.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $g: \R^n \to \R$ be a density.
Let $d$ denote the differential
relative entropy.
We want to
\[
  \minimizationn{
    \text{ density } f \text{ and tree } T \text{ on } \set{1, \dots, n}
  }{
    d(g, f)
  }{
    f \text{ factors according to } T.
  }
\]

\ssection{Solution}

\begin{prop}
  Let $g: \R^n \to \R$ be a density.
  Let $T$ be
  a tree on $\set{1, \dots, n}$.
  Let $p_j$ be
  the parent of vertex $j$ for the $T$ rooted
  at vertex $i$, $j = 1,\dots,n$ and $j \neq i$.
  Then the density $f: \R^d \to \R$ defined by
  \[
    f = g_i \prod_{j \neq i} g_{j \mid p_j}
  \]
  achieves minimum differential entropy relative to $g$ among
  all densities which factor according to $T$.
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}
  Let $g: \R^n \to \R$ be a density.
  A tree $T$ is a solution to the problem above
  if and only if it is a maximum spanning
  tree of the differential mutual information graph of $g$.
\end{prop}
