\ssection{Why}

Can we approximate a density by a tree density in a similar manner to how we handled distributions?

\ssection{Definition}

Tree density approximation is an optimization problem in which we select a tree density whose entropy relative to a given density is minimal.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $g: \R^n \to \R$ be a density.
Let $d$ denote the differential
relative entropy.
We want to
\[
  \minimizationn{
    \text{ density } f \text{ and tree } T \text{ on } \set{1, \dots, n}
  }{
    d(g, f)
  }{
    f \text{ factors according to } T.
  }
\]
