\section{Why}

Of course matrices of real numbers
are the most important of all.

\ssection{Definition}

A \ct{real-valued matrix}{} or
\ct{matrix of real numbers}{}
or \ct{matrix}{} is a matrix in the real
numbers.

\ssubsection{Notation}

We denote the set $n$ by $m$
real-valued matrices
by $\RMat{n}{m}$.
