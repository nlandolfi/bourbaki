\section*{Why}

We compress the notation for linear equations.

\section*{Definition}

A \t{real matrix} (\t{matrix}, \t{rectangular array}) is a two-dimensional array of real numbers.
We denote the elements of a matrix in a grid between two rectangular braces, as in
\[
A = \bmat{
A_{11} & A_{12} & \cdots & A_{1n} \\
A_{21} & A_{22} & \cdots & A_{2n} \\
\vdots & & \ddots & \vdots \\
A_{m1} & A_{m2} & \cdots & A_{mn} \\
}.
\]

We call $m$ and $n$ the \t{dimensions} of the matrix.
We call $m$ the \t{height} and $n$ the \t{width}.
If the height of the matrix is the same as the width of the matrix then we call the matrix \t{square}.
If the height is larger than the width, we call the matrix \t{tall}.
If the width is larger than the height, we call the matrix \t{wide}.

\subsection*{Linear equations}

Recall that we are interested in solutions of the linear equations
\[
\begin{aligned}
y_1 &= A_{11}x_1 + A_{12}x_2 + \cdots + A_{1n}x_n, \\
y_2 &= A_{21}x_1 + A_{22}x_2 + \cdots + A_{2n}x_n, \\
&\vdots \\
y_n &= A_{m1}x_1 + A_{m2}x_2 + \cdots + A_{mn}x_n. \\
\end{aligned}
\]
We have suggestively used the notation $A_{ij}$ for the coefficients of the equations, so they are the entries of $A \in \R ^{m \times  n}$.

\section*{A primer on matrix-vector products}

Using the notation $A \in \R ^{m \times  n}$ and $x \in \R ^n$ we want a compressed way to write the above system of linear equations.
Define the \t{real matrix-vector product} $z \in \R ^m$ of $A$ with $x$ by
\[
z_{i} = \sum_{j = 1}^{n} A_{ij}x_j, \quad i = 1, \dots , m.
\]
We denote the matrix vector product $z$ by $Ax$.

\subsection*{Notation}

We express the above system of linear equations as
\[
y = Ax,
\]
where $y = (y_1, \dots , y_n) \in \R ^{n}$ and $x = (x_1, \dots , x_n) \in \R ^n$.
The compact notation $y = Ax$ is sometimes called the \t{matrix form} of the $m$ linear equations and $A$ the \t{coefficient matrix}.

\subsection*{Note on terminology}

The word ``matrix'' is from the Latin ``mater,'' meaning mother, and has an old sense in English similar ``womb.''
The matrix is source of many determinants (discussed elsewhere).
