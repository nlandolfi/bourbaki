\section{Why}

Matrices of real numbers are important.\footnote{Future editions will expand.}

\ssection{Definition}

A \t{real-valued matrix} or \t{matrix of real numbers} or \t{matrix} is a matrix in the real numbers.

\ssubsection{Notation}

We denote the set $n$ by $m$ real-valued matrices by $\RMat{n}{m}$.
