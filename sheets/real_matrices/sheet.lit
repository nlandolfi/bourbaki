§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We compress the notation for linear equations. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬real matrix❭ (❬matrix❭, ❬rectangular array❭) is a
    two-dimensional array of real numbers. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the elements of a matrix in a grid between two
    rectangular braces, as in
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ A = \bmat{ ⦉

      ‖ A_{11} ❲&❳ A_{12} ❲&❳ ⋯ ❲&❳ A_{1n} ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ A_{21} ❲&❳ A_{22} ❲&❳ ⋯ ❲&❳ A_{2n} ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ \vdots ❲&❳ ❲&❳ \ddots ❲&❳ \vdots ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ A_{m1} ❲&❳ A_{m2} ❲&❳ ⋯ ❲&❳ A_{mn} ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ }. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We call $m$ and $n$ the ❬dimensions❭ of the matrix. ⦉

  ‖ We call $m$ the ❬height❭ and $n$ the ❬width❭. ⦉

  ‖ If the height of the matrix is the same as the width of
    the matrix then we call the matrix ❬square❭. ⦉

  ‖ If the height is larger than the width, we call the matrix
    ❬tall❭. ⦉

  ‖ If the width is larger than the height, we call the matrix
    ❬wide❭. ⦉
⦉

§§ Linear equations ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Recall that we are interested in solutions of the linear
    equations
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \begin{aligned} ⦉

      ‖ y_1 ❲&❳= A_{11}x_1 + A_{12}x_2 + ⋯ + A_{1n}x_n, ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ y_2 ❲&❳= A_{21}x_1 + A_{22}x_2 + ⋯ + A_{2n}x_n, ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ ❲&❳⋮ ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ y_n ❲&❳= A_{m1}x_1 + A_{m2}x_2 + ⋯ + A_{mn}x_n. ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ \end{aligned} ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ We have suggestively used the notation $A_{ij}$ for the
    coefficients of the equations, so they are the entries of $A
    ∈ 𝗥^{m × n}$. ⦉
⦉

§ A primer on matrix-vector products ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Using the notation $A ∈ 𝗥^{m × n}$ and $x ∈ 𝗥^n$ we want
    a compressed way to write the above system of linear
    equations. ⦉

  ‖ Define the ❬real matrix-vector product❭ $z ∈ 𝗥^m$ of $A$
    with $x$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ z_{i} = ∑_{j = 1}^{n} A_{ij}x_j, \quad i = 1, …, m. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ We denote the matrix vector product $z$ by $Ax$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We express the above system of linear equations as
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ y = Ax, ⦉
    ⦉
    where $y = (y_1, …, y_n) ∈ 𝗥^{n}$ and $x = (x_1, …, x_n)
    ∈ 𝗥^n$. ⦉

  ‖ The compact notation $y = Ax$ is sometimes called the
    ❬matrix form❭ of the $m$ linear equations and $A$ the
    ❬coefficient matrix❭. ⦉
⦉

§§ Note on terminology ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The word “matrix” is from the Latin “mater,” meaning mother,
    and has an old sense in English similar “womb.” ⦉

  ‖ The matrix is source of many determinants (discussed
    elsewhere). ⦉
