\stitle{Empty Set}

\ssection{Why}

If there is a set, there is an empty set.
Are there many such sets?
How do they (or it) relate to other sets?

\ssection{Definition}

First, we assume there exists a set.
As a consequence, there exists a set which contains no elements at all.
We use the axiom of specification with a condition that is always false, and so selects no elements.

As a result of the axiom of extension, this set with no elements is unique.
We call this empty set \t{the empty set.}

\ssection{Notation}

We denote the empty set by $\emptyset$.
