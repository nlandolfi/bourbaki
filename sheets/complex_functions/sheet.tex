\ssection{Why}

We name functions whose domain is the complex numbers.

\ssection{Definition}

A \t{complex function} is a complex-valued function.
The domain is often an interval of the real numbers, but may be any non-empty set.\footnote{Future editions will expand the discussion, and likely motivate the definition via the genetic approach.}

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $A$ be a set.
Let $f: A \to \C$.
$f$ is a complex function.
