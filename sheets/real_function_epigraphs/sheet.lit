§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $f: D → R$ be a multivariate real-valued function where
    $D ⊂ 𝗥^d$. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬graph❭ of $f$ is the set in $𝗥^{d + 1}$ defined by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \Set{(x, f(x)) ∈ 𝗥^d × 𝗥}{x ∈ D} ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Of course, in these sheets, the graph is the ‹same object›
    as the function $f$ (see discussion in␣
    <a href='/sheets/functions.html'>
      ‖ Functions ⦉
    </a>
    ). ⦉

  ‖ The ❬epigraph❭ of $f$ is the set in $𝗥^{d + 1}$ defined
    by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \Set{(x, α) ∈ D × 𝗥}{f(x) ≤ α}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ The prefix “epi” is Greek, meaning “upon” or “above”. ⦉

  ‖ It is merited (see the visualization below) by the fact
    that $f ≠ \epi f$. ⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the epigraph of a function $f$ by $\epi f$. ⦉
⦉

§ Extension to extended real numbers ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We can extend this concept in the natural way to extended
    real value function $f: D → \Rbar$.
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \epi f \Set{(x, α) ∈ D × 𝗥}{f(x) ≤ α} ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Caution, in this case $f \not⊂ \epi f$. ⦉
