§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ What is the inverse element under matrix multiplication. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Recall that if $A ∈ 𝗥^{m × n}$ then $x ↦ Ax$ is a
    function from $𝗥^{n}$ to $𝗥^{m}$. ⦉

  ‖ Clearly, if $m ≠ n$, then the inverse of $f$ can not
    exist.

⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Now suppose that $A ∈ 𝗥^{n × n}$. ⦉

  ‖ Of course, the inverse may not exist. ⦉

  ‖ Consider, for example if $A$ was the $n$ by $n$ matrix of
    zeros. ⦉

  ‖ If there exists a matrix $B$ so that $BA = I$ we call
    $B$ the ❬left inverse❭ of $A$ and likewise if $AC = I$ we
    call $C$ the ❬right inverse❭ of $A$. ⦉

  ‖ In the case that $A$ is square, the right inverse and left
    inverse coincide. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Let $A, B, C ∈ 𝗥^{n × n}$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $BA = I$ and $AC = I$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $B = C$. ⦉
  <proof>
    ‖ Since $BA = AC$ we have $BBA = BAC$ so $B = C$ since
      $BA = I$. ⦉
  </proof>
</statement>

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $𝗙$ be a field. ⦉

  ‖ Let $A ∈ 𝗙^{n × n}$ ⦉

  ‖ be invertible. ⦉

  ‖ We follow the notation of ⦉

  ‖ inverse elements and denote ⦉

  ‖ the inverse of $A$ by ⦉

  ‖ $A^{-1}$. ⦉
