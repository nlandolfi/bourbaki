\ssection{Why}

Many problems simplify if the graph involved is chordal.\footnote{Future editions will expand.}

\ssection{Paths}

Let $G$ be an undirected graph.
A \t{chord} in a path $p$ of $G$ is an edge between two non-consecutive vertices of $p$.
So a chord of the path $(v_1, v_1, \dots, v_{k})$ is an edge $\set{v_i, v_j}$ with $\intabs{j - i} > 1$.

We interpret a chord as a \say{one-edge shortcut} between two vertices of a path.
If a path $p$ has a chord, it can be reduced to a shorter path $p'$ by \say{skipping} vertices.
In other words, the shortest path between two vertices is chordless.
However, a chordless path need not be a shortest path.
See Figure~\ref{figure:chordal_graphs:chords}.

\ssection{Graphs}

A chord of a cycle $(v_1, v_2, \dots, v_{k-1}, v_1)$ is an edge $\set{v_i, v_j}$ with $(j - i) \mod k > 1$.
An undirected graph $G$ is \t{chordal} if every cycle with more than three edges has a chord.

If $G$ is chordal, every cycle in $G$ can be reduced to a cycle of length three.
We sometimes call a cycle of length three a \t{triangle}.
For this reason, chordal graphs are also sometimes called \t{triangulated graphs}.
Other terminology includes \t{rigid-circuit graphs}, \t{triangulated graphs}, \t{perfect elimination graphs}, \t{decomposable graphs}.\footnote{See Vanenberghe and Anderson, 2014.}

The last graph in Figure~\ref{figure:chordal_graphs:chords} is not chordal because the cycle $(a, b, d, c, a)$ has length four and no chord.
Adding the edge $\set{b, c}$ or $\set{a, d}$ would make the graph chordal
An immediate consequence of the definition that $G$ be chordal is that any subgraph of $G$ is chordal.


\ssection{Simple Examples}

Since trees and forests have no cycles, they are chordal.
Similarly, any graph with no cycles longer than three edges are trivially chordal.
Such graphs are sometimes called \t{cactus graphs}.
The complete graphs are also trivially chordal.

  The edge $\set{e, d}$ is a chord in the path $(a, e, c, d)$ of the first graph. The path $(a, v, d, c)$ is chordless.
  The edge $\set{a, e}$ is a chord in the cycle $(a, v, e, c, a)$ of the second graph.
  The cycle $(a, b, d, c, a)$ is chordless.
