%!need:probability_densities

\ssection{Why}

We have a dataset in some infinite set and want to summarize it by a probability density.

\ssection{Overview}

We have an set uncountable set of outcomes $A$.
We have a dataset $(a^1, \dots, a^n)$.  We want to define a correspondence between the dataset and probability densities over the set of outcomes $A$.

A \t{density selector} for a dataset of size $n$ is a function which maps datasets of size $n$ in $A$ to densities on $A$.
We do not want a density on the record sequences $A^n$, but rather a density on $A$.
