§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ How many ways are there to arrange $n$ people at a table
    with $n$ seats? ⦉

  ‖ In other words, how many ways can we order $n$ objects? ⦉
⦉

§ Discussion ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ There is one way to arrange a single person and there are
    two ways to arrange two people. ⦉

  ‖ What of three? ⦉

  ‖ First, we can pick a seat, and decide which person to put
    in that chair. ⦉

  ‖ We have three choices of people. ⦉

  ‖ Then, whomever we choose, there are only two ways to seat
    the other two people in the other two chairs. ⦉

  ‖ Since there were three ways of picking whom to sit in the
    firs seat, there are $3×2 = 6$ ways to order the three
    people. ⦉

  ‖ We reason similarly for four people. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $f: 𝗡 → 𝗡$ be defined recursively by $f(1) = 1$ and
    $f(2) = 2f(1)$, and $f(n) = nf(n-1)$ for $n ∈ 𝗡$. ⦉

  ‖ $f$ exists by the recursion theorem (see␣
    <a href='/sheets/recursion_theorem.html'>
      ‖ Recursion Theorem ⦉
    </a>
    ). ⦉

  ‖ We call the result $f(n)$ of $n$ the ❬factorial❭ of $n$. ⦉

  ‖ We call $f$ the ❬factorial function❭. ⦉
⦉

§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the factorial of $n$ by $n!$, read aloud “n
    factorial”. ⦉
