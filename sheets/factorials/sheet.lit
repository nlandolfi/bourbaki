§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ How many ways are there to arrange $n$ objects in order? ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ By the fundamental principle of counting, there are $n$ ways
    to select the first card, $n-1$ ways to select the second,
    and so on. ⦉

  ‖ Thus, the number of ways of stacking $n$ cards in a deck
    is
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ n(n-1)(n-2)⋯1 ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ We call this number the ❬factorial❭ of $n$, or
    ❬$n$-factorial❭. ⦉

 <div data-littype='run'> There is one way to arrange a single person and there are

 <div data-littype='run'> What of three? </div>

 <div data-littype='run'> First, we can pick a seat, and decide which person to put
    in that chair. </div>

 <div data-littype='run'> We have three choices of people. </div>

 <div data-littype='run'> Then, whomever we choose, there are only two ways to seat
    the other two people in the other two chairs. </div>

 <div data-littype='run'> Since there were three ways of picking whom to sit in the
    firs seat, there are $3×2 = 6$ ways to order the three
    people. </div>

 <div data-littype='run'> We reason similarly for four people. </div>

  ‖ Define $f: 𝗡 → 𝗡$ recursively by $f(1) = 1$ and $f(2) =
    2f(1)$, and $f(n) = nf(n-1)$ for $n ∈ 𝗡$ ($f$ exists by
    the the recursion theorem—see␣
    <a href='/sheets/recursion_theorem.html'>
      ‖ Recursion Theorem ⦉
    </a>
    ). ⦉

  ‖ $f$ is defined such that $f(n)$ is $n$ factorial, for which
    reason we call $f$ the ❬factorial function❭. ⦉

  ‖ For convenience, we extend $f$ to $ω$

⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the factorial of $n$ by $n!$, read aloud “n
    factorial”. ⦉

  ‖ So for example, $5! = 5·4·3·2·1$ and $0! = 1$. ⦉
