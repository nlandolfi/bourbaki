§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We have seen that the integrable functions form a vector
    space. ⦉

  ‖ How about the square integrable functions? ⦉

  ‖ And so on.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future sheets are likely to begin with $L^2$. ⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬integrable function spaces❭ are a collection of function
    spaces, one for each real number $p ≥ 1$, for which the
    $p$th power of the absolute value of the function is
    integrable.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will include the case where $p = ∞$. ⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ be a measure space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $p ≥ 1$. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the integrable function space corresponding to $p$
    by $ℒ^p(X, 𝒜, μ, 𝗥)$. ⦉

  ‖ We have defined it by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ ℒ^p(X, 𝒜, μ, 𝗥) = \Set*{ ⦉

      ‖ \text{ measurable } f: X → 𝗥 ⦉

      ‖ }{ ⦉

      ‖ ∫ \abs{f}^p dμ < ∞ ⦉

      ‖ } ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $𝗖$ denote the set of complex numbers. ⦉

  ‖ Similarly for complex-valued functions, we denote the $p$th
    space by $ℒ^p(X, 𝒜, μ, 𝗖)$. ⦉
