\ssection{Why}

We have seen that the
integrable functions form
a vector space.
How about the square
integrable functions?
TODO: perhaps
do $L^2$ first
then generalize.

\ssection{Definition}

The
\ct{integrable function spaces}{}
are a collection of function spaces,
one for each real number $p \geq 1$,
for which
the $p$th power
of the absolute
value of the function
is integrable.

TODO: case $\infty$

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(X, \SA, \mu)$ be a
measure space.
Let $p \geq 1$.
Let $R$ denote the set
of real numbers.
We denote the integrable
function space corresponding
to $p$ by $\SL^p(X, \SA, \mu, R)$.
We have defined it by
\[
  \SL^p(X, \SA, \mu, R) = \Set*{
    \text{ measurable } f: X \to R
  }{
    \int \abs{f}^p d\mu < \infty
  }
\]

Let $C$ denote the set
of complex numbers.
Similarly for complex-valued
functions, we denote the $p$th
space by
$\SL^p(X, \SA, \mu, C)$.
