Can permuting the rows or columns of a matrix be represented by matrix multiplication?

\section*{Definition}

Let $\sigma  : \upto{n} \to \upto{n}$ be a permutation of $n$.
The \t{permutation matrix} of $\sigma  $ is the matrix $P$ defined by $P_{ij} = 1$ if $\sigma  (i) = j$ and 0 otherwise.
This is sometimes called the \t{column representation} (in contrast to the row representation, in which $P_{ij} = 1$ if $\sigma  (j) = i$.

Let $A \in \R  ^{n \times  n}$.
Then pre-multipying $A$ by $P$ permutes the rows of $A$.
In other words $PA$ has the same rows as $A$ but permuted according to $\sigma  $.
Similarly, post-multiplying by $P$ permutes the columns of $A$.
In other words, $AP$ has the same columns as $A$ but permuted according to $\sigma  $.
Clearly, we can also speak of permuting the components of a vector.

\section*{Composition}

Let $\pi  , \sigma  \in S_n$ with corresponding permutation matrices $P_\sigma  $ and $P_\pi  $.
Then $P_{\pi  }P_{\sigma  }A$ has the same rows as $A$ but permuted by $\pi  \sigma  $.
Likewise, $AP_{\pi  }P_{\sigma  }$ has the same columns as $A$ but permuted by $\pi  \sigma  $.
Clearly, the identity permutation on $\upto{n}$ is the identity $I \in \R  ^{n \times  n}$.

\section*{Inverses}

It is clear from the definition that $P_{\sigma  }^{-1} = P_{\sigma  ^{-1}}$ and so if $P$ is a permutation matrix then $P^{-1}$ is $P^\top $.
