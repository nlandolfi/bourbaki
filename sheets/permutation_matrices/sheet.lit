¶ ⦊
  ‖ Can permuting the rows or columns of a matrix be
    represented by matrix multiplication? ⦉

⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $σ: \upto{n} → \upto{n}$ be a permutation of $n$. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬permutation matrix❭ of $σ$ is the matrix $P$ defined
    by $P_{ij} = 1$ if $σ(i) = j$ and 0 otherwise. ⦉

  ‖ This is sometimes called the ❬column representation❭ (in
    contrast to the row representation, in which $P_{ij} = 1$ if
    $σ(j) = i$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A ∈ 𝗥^{n × n}$. ⦉

  ‖ Then pre-multipying $A$ by $P$ permutes the rows of $A$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words $PA$ has the same rows as $A$ but permuted
    according to $σ$. ⦉

  ‖ Similarly, post-multiplying by $P$ permutes the columns of
    $A$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, $AP$ has the same columns as $A$ but
    permuted according to $σ$. ⦉

  ‖ Clearly, we can also speak of permuting the components of a
    vector. ⦉

⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $π, σ ∈ S_n$ with corresponding permutation matrices
    $P_σ$ and $P_π$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $P_{π}P_{σ}A$ has the same rows as $A$ but permuted by
    $πσ$. ⦉

  ‖ Likewise, $AP_{π}P_{σ}$ has the same columns as $A$ but
    permuted by $πσ$. ⦉

  ‖ Clearly, the identity permutation on $\upto{n}$ is the
    identity $I ∈ 𝗥^{n × n}$. ⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ \ssection{Inverses} ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ It is clear from the definition that $P_{σ}^{-1} =
    P_{σ^{-1}}$ and so if $P$ is a permutation matrix then
    $P^{-1}$ is $\transpose{P}$. ⦉
