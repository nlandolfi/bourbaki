§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Can permuting the rows or columns of a matrix be
    represented by matrix multiplication? ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $σ : \upto{n} → \upto{n}$ be a permutation of $n$. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬permutation matrix❭ of $σ $ is the matrix $P$ defined
    by $P_{ij} = 1$ if $σ(i) = j$ and 0 otherwise. ⦉

  ‖ This is sometimes called the ❬column representation❭ (in
    contrast to the ❬row representation❭, in which $P_{ij} = 1$
    if $σ(j) = i$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A ∈ 𝗥^{n × n}$. ⦉

  ‖ Then pre-multipying $A$ by $P$ permutes the rows of $A$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words $PA$ has the same rows as $A$ but permuted
    according to $σ$. ⦉

  ‖ Similarly, post-multiplying by $P$ permutes the columns of
    $A$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, $AP$ has the same columns as $A$ but
    permuted according to $σ $. ⦉

  ‖ Clearly, we can also speak of permuting the components of a
    vector. ⦉
⦉

§ Composition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $π , σ ∈ S_n$ with corresponding permutation matrices
    $P_σ $ and $P_π $. ⦉

  ‖ Then $P_{π }P_{σ }A$ has the same rows as $A$ but permuted
    by $π σ $. ⦉

  ‖ Likewise, $AP_{π }P_{σ }$ has the same columns as $A$ but
    permuted by $π σ $. ⦉

  ‖ Clearly, the identity permutation on $\upto{n}$ is the
    identity $I ∈ 𝗥 ^{n × n}$. ⦉
⦉

§ Inverses ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ It is clear from the definition that $P_{σ }^{-1} = P_{σ
    ^{-1}}$ and so if $P$ is a permutation matrix then $P^{-1}$
    is $P^⊤$. ⦉
