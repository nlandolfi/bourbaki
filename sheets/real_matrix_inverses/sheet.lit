§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A ∈ 𝗥^{m × n}$ and define $f: 𝗥^n → 𝗥^m$ by $f(x)
    = Ax$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $f$ is a linear function from $𝗥^{n}$ to $𝗥^{m}$. ⦉

  ‖ Conversely, suppose $g: 𝗥^n → 𝗥^m$ is a linear function. ⦉

  ‖ Then there exists a matrix $B ∈ 𝗥^{m × n}$ so that $g(z)
    = Bz$. ⦉

  ‖ Does this function have an inverse? ⦉
⦉

§ Derivation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ If $A ∈ 𝗥^{m × n}$, with $m ≠ n$, then the inverse of
    $f$ can not exist. ⦉

  ‖ For a ‹square› matrix $A ∈ 𝗥^{n × n}$, $B ∈ 𝗥^{n × n}$
    is a ❬left inverse❭ if $BA = I$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, $B$ is a left inverse element of $A$ in
    the algebra of matrices with the operation of multiplication. ⦉

  ‖ $C ∈ 𝗥^{n × n}$ is a ❬right inverse❭ if $AC = I$. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We call a square matrix $A$ ❬invertible❭ if there is $B ∈
    𝗥^{n × n}$ so that $BA = I$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Now suppose that $A ∈ 𝗥^{n × n}$. ⦉

  ‖ Of course, the inverse may not exist. ⦉

  ‖ Consider, for example if $A$ was the $n$ by $n$ matrix of
    zeros. ⦉

  ‖ If there exists a matrix $B$ so that $BA = I$ we call
    $B$ the ❬left inverse❭ of $A$ and likewise if $AC = I$ we
    call $C$ the ❬right inverse❭ of $A$. ⦉

  ‖ In the case that $A$ is square, the right inverse and left
    inverse coincide. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Let $A, B, C ∈ 𝗥^{n × n}$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $BA = I$ and $AC = I$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $B = C$. ⦉
  <proof>
    ‖ Since $BA = AC$ we have $BBA = BAC$ so $B = C$ since
      $BA = I$. ⦉
