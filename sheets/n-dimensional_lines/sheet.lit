§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given two distinct points $x$ and $y$ in $𝗥^n$, the ❬line❭
    through $x$ and $y$ is the set of points expressable as the
    sum of $x$ and $α(y-x)$ where $α ∈ 𝗥$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ In other words, the line through $x$ and $y$ is the set
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \Set{z ∈ 𝗥^n}{∃ α ∈ 𝗥, z = x + α(y - x)} = \Set{x
        + α(y-x)}{α ∈ 𝗥} ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ The second expression is notation for the first, and is
    called the ❬set-generator notation❭. ⦉

  ‖ Notice that if $z = x + α(y-x)$, then
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ z = (1 - α)x + αy, ⦉
    ⦉
    where $α ∈ 𝗥$ and $x, y ∈ 𝗥^n$. ⦉

  ‖ This highlights the obvious (and obviously desirable) property
    that the definition is symmetric in $x$ and $y$. ⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the line through $x$ and $y$ by $L(x,y)$. ⦉
⦉

§ Properties ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ There are a few nice properties. ⦉

  ‖ If $x ≠ y$, then $L(x, y) = L(y, x)$. ⦉

  ‖ Also, if $v$ and $w$ are in $L(x, y)$ and $v ≠ w$, then
    the line through $v$ and $w$ is the same as the line
    through $x$ and $y$. ⦉

  ‖ In symbols
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ L(v, w) = L(x, y) ⦉
