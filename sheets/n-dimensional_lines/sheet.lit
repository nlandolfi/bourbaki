§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given two distinct points $x ≠ y$ in $𝗥^n$, the ❬line❭
    through $x$ and $y$ is the set of points expressable as the
    sum of $x$ and $α(y-x)$ where $α ∈ 𝗥$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ In other words, the line through $x$ and $y$ is
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \Set{z ∈ 𝗥^n}{∃ α ∈ 𝗥, z = x + α(y - x)}. ⦉
    ⦉

    ‖ Notice that if $z = x + α(x-y)$, then
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ z = (1 - α)x + αy, ⦉
      ⦉
      where $α ∈ 𝗥$ and $x, y ∈ 𝗥^n$. ⦉⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the line through $x$ and $y$ by $L(x,y)$. ⦉
