§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given two points $x, y ∈ 𝗥^n$, the ❬line❭ through $x$ and
    $y$ is the set of points which can be expressed as the sum
    of $x$ and $α(y-x)$ where $α ∈ 𝗥$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ In other words, the line through $x$ and $y$ is
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \Set{z ∈ 𝗥^n}{∃ α ∈ 𝗥, z = x + α(y - x)}. ⦉
    ⦉

    ‖ If there exists $α ∈ 𝗥^n$ such $z ∈ 𝗥^n$ satisfies
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ z = x + α(y - x), ⦉
      ⦉
      then $z = (1 - α)x + αy$. ⦉⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the line through $x$ and $y$ by $L(x,y)$. ⦉
