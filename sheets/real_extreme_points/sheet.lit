§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $A ⊂ 𝗥^d$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $a ∈ A$ is an ❬extreme point❭ of $A$ if there does
    not exist points $b, c ∈ 𝗥^n$, $b ≠ c$ with $a ∈ [b, c]$. ⦉

  <!-- show that this is equivalent to Barvinok's definition -->
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the extreme points of $A$ by $\ex(A)$. ⦉
