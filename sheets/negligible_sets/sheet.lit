  ‖ \ssection{Why} ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Some reasonable statements do not hold ‹for all› elements of
    the base set of a measurable space. ⦉

  ‖ Even so, these statements often hold “broadly,” in the sense
    that the measure of the set on which they fail is small
    (i.e., zero). ⦉

  ‖ With this idea, we can often treat statements which fail on
    a set of measure zero as though they occur everywhere. ⦉

  ‖ We take this route especially often in discussions of
    convergence and integration. ⦉
⦉

  ‖ \ssection{Definition} ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A subset of the base set of a measure space is
    ❬negligible❭ if there exists a measurable set with measure
    zero containing the subset. ⦉

  ‖ The qualification “if there exists a measurable set...”
    allows us to speak of nonmeasurable negligible sets. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, negligible sets need not be measurable. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊

  ‖ A property holds ❬almost everywhere❭ with respect to a
    measure on a measure space if the set of elements of the
    base set on which the property does not hold is negligible. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Naturally, if the property holds everywhere then it holds
    almost everywhere, too, though we always use the stronger
    statement that it holds everywhere. ⦉

  ‖ With this in mind, we call the almost everywhere sense
    “weaker” than the everywhere sense. ⦉

⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, \mathcal{A}, μ)$ be a measure space. ⦉

  ‖ A set $N ⊂ X$ is negligible if there exists $A ∈
    \mathcal{A}$ with $N ⊂ A$ and $μ(N) = 0$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We abbreviate almost everywhere as \say{a.e.,} read
    \say{almost everywhere}. ⦉

  ‖ We say that a property \say{holds a.e.} ⦉

  ‖ If the measure $μ$ is not clear from context, we say that
    the property holds almost everywhere $[μ]$ or $μ$-a.e., read
    \say{mu almost everywhere.} ⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $f, g: X → 𝗥$, not necessarily measurable. ⦉

  ‖ Then $f = g$ almost everywhere if the set of points at
    which the functions disagree is ⦉

  ‖ $μ$-negligible. ⦉

  ‖ Similarly, $f ≥ g$ almost everywhere if the set of points
    where $f$ is less than $g$ is $μ$-negligible. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Now suppose $f$ and $g$ are $\mathcal{A}$-measurable, then
    the sets

      ‖ \Set*{x ∈ X}{f(x) < g(x)} ⦉
    ⦉
    ‖ are measurable. ⦉

    ‖ In general, these sets need not be measurable. ⦉

    ‖ This is one example justification for our including
      nonmeasurable sets in the definition, as mentioned above. ⦉⦉

  ‖ \ssubsection{Function Limits} ⦉

  ‖ Let $\seqt{f}: X → R$ for each natural number $n$ and let
    $f: X → R$ be a function. ⦉

        or } f(x) ≠ \lim_{n} \seqt{f}(x)} ⦉
    ⦉
    is $μ$-negligible. ⦉

  ‖ In this case, we write “$f = \lim_n \seqt{f}$ a.e.” ⦉
