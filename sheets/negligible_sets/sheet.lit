§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Some reasonable statements do not hold ‹for all› elements of
    the base set of a measurable space. ⦉

  ‖ Even so, these statements often hold ‹broadly›, in the sense
    that the measure of the set on which they fail is zero. ⦉

  ‖ This idea allows one to handle statements which fail on a
    set of measure zero as though they hold everywhere. ⦉

  ‖ This approach is useful in discussions of convergence and
    integration. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ For this sheet, suppose $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ is a␣
    <a href='/sheets/measures.html'>
      ‖ measure space ⦉
    </a>
    . ⦉

  ‖ Call a set $N ⊂ X$ ❬negligible❭ if there exists a
    measurable set $A ∈ 𝒜$ with $μ(A) = 0$ and $N ⊂ A$. ⦉

  ‖ In english, there is a measurable set containing $N$ that
    has measure zero. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The qualification “if there exists a measurable set...”
    enables one to speak of ‹nonmeasurable› negligible sets. ⦉

  ‖ Negligible sets need not be measurable. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given the measure $μ$, a␣
    <a href='/sheets/set_specification.html'>
      ‖ statement ⦉
    </a>
    ␣$s$ holds ❬almost everywhere❭ with respect to $μ$ if the
    set of elements on which the statement fails is negligible. ⦉

  ‖ In symbols, there exists $A ∈ 𝒜$ with $μ(A) = 0$ and
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \Set{x ∈ X}{\neg s(x)} ⊂ A ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A statement which holds “everywhere” holds “almost everywhere”
    also. ⦉

  ‖ With this in mind, we call the almost everywhere sense
    “weaker” than the everywhere sense. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We abbreviate almost everywhere as “a.e.,” read “almost
    everywhere”. ⦉

  ‖ We say that a statement “holds a.e.” ⦉

  ‖ If the measure $μ$ is not clear from context, we say that
    the property holds almost everywhere $[μ]$ or $μ$-a.e., read
    “mu almost everywhere.” ⦉
⦉

§§ Function comparisons ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $f, g: X → 𝗥$, not necessarily measurable. ⦉

  ‖ Then $f = g$ almost everywhere if the set of points at
    which the functions disagree is ⦉

  ‖ $μ$-negligible. ⦉

  ‖ Similarly, $f ≥ g$ almost everywhere if the set of points
    where $f$ is less than $g$ is $μ$-negligible. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ If $f$ and $g$ were both in fact $𝒜$-measurable, then the
    sets
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \Set*{x ∈ X}{f(x) ≠ g(x)} ⦉

      ‖ \text{ and } ⦉

      ‖ \Set*{x ∈ X}{f(x) < g(x)} ⦉
    ⦉

    ‖ would be measurable also. ⦉

    ‖ But in general, these sets need not be measurable, and so
      this is one simple example to justify our including
      nonmeasurable sets in the definition of neglible sets, as
      mentioned above. ⦉⦉
⦉

§§ Function limits ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $\seqt{f}: X → R$ for each natural number $n$ and let
    $f: X → R$ be a function. ⦉

  ‖ The sequence $\seq{f}$ ❬converges to $f$ almost everywhere❭
    if
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \Set*{x ∈ X}{\lim_{n} \seqt{f}(x) \text{ does not exist,
        or } f(x) ≠ \lim_{n} \seqt{f}(x)} ⦉
    ⦉
    is $μ$-negligible. ⦉

  ‖ In this case, we write “$f = \lim_n \seqt{f}$ a.e.” ⦉
