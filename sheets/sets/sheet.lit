§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to talk about none, one, or several objects
    considered together, as an aggregate. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ When we think of several objects considered as an intangible
    whole, or group, we call the intangible object which is the
    group a ❬set❭. ⦉

  ‖ We say that these objects ❬belong❭ to the set. ⦉

  ‖ They are the set’s ❬members❭ or ❬elements❭. ⦉

  ‖ They are ❬in❭ the set. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A set may have other sets as its members. ⦉

  ‖ This is subtle but becomes familiar. ⦉

  ‖ We call a set which contains no objects ❬empty❭. ⦉

  ‖ Otherwise we call a set ❬nonempty❭. ⦉
⦉

§ Denoting a set ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A$ denote a set. ⦉

  ‖ Then $A$ is a name for an object. ⦉

  ‖ That object is a set. ⦉

  ‖ So $A$ is a name for an object which is a grouping of
    other objects. ⦉
⦉

§ Belonging ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $a$ denote an object and $A$ denote a set. ⦉

  ‖ So we are using the names $a$ and $A$ as placeholders for
    some object and some set, we do not particularly know which. ⦉

  ‖ Suppose though, that whatever this object and set are, it
    is the case that the object belongs to the set. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, the object is a member or an element of
    the set. ⦉

  ‖ We say “The object denoted by $a$ belongs to the set
    denoted by $A$”. ⦉
⦉

§ Not symmetric ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Notice that belonging is not symmetric. ⦉

  ‖ Saying “the object denoted by $a$ belongs to the set
    denoted by $A$” does not mean the same as “the set denoted
    by $A$ belongs to the object denoted by $a$.” ⦉

  ‖ In fact, the latter sentence is nonsensical unless the
    object denoted by $a$ is also a set. ⦉
⦉

§ Not transitive ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $a$ denote an object and let $A$ and $B$ both denote
    sets. ⦉

  ‖ If the object denoted by $a$ is “a part of” the set
    denoted by $A$, and the set denoted by $A$ is “a part
    of” the set denoted by $B$, then usual English usage would
    suggest that $a$ is “a part of” the set denoted by $B$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, if a thing is a part of a second thing,
    and the second thing is part of a third thing, then the
    first thing is often said to be a part of the third thing. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The relation of belonging does not follow this familiar
    usage. ⦉

  ‖ In contrast, if an object is an element of a set, that
    set may be an element of another set, but this does not
    mean that the the first object is also an element of that
    other set. ⦉

  ‖ The upshot is that sets are nested: we can have intangible
    groups of intangible groups, and have them be different than
    the intangible group of all the members of each group. ⦉
