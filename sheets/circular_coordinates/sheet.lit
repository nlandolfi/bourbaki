§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We identified points in $𝗥^2$ with elements of the plane in
    a natural way.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will expand on this in the genetic
        approach, and likely reference celestial motion. ⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(x, y) ∈ 𝗥^2$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $(r, θ) ∈ 𝗥^2$ is the ❬polar form❭ or ❬circular form❭
    of $(x, y)$ if
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ x = r \cos θ \quad \text{ and } \quad y = r \sin θ
        . ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ In this case we call $r$ and $θ$ the ❬circular coordinates❭
    or ❬polar coordinates❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Since $\sin$ and $\cos$ polar coordinates are not unique. ⦉
⦉

§ Non-uniqueness ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A difficulty with polar coordinates is that there are many
    elements of $𝗥^2$ that correspond to the same point in the
    plane. ⦉

  ‖ For example, consider the points
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ (5, π/3), (5, -5π/3), (-5, 4π/3), (-5, -2π/3). ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Each of these specifies the same point in $𝗥^2$. ⦉
