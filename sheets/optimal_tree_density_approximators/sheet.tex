Which is the optimal tree to use for tree density approximation?

\section*{Definition}

We want to choose the tree whose corresponding approximator for the given density achieves minimum relative entropy with the given density among all tree density approximators.
We call such a density an \t{optimal tree approximator} of the given density.
We call a tree according to which an optimal tree approximator factors and optimal approximator tree.

\section*{Result}

\begin{proposition}
Let $g: \R ^n \to [0, 1]$ be a density.
A tree $T$ on $\set{1, \dots , n}$ is an optimal approximator tree if and only if it is a maximal spanning tree of the differential mutual information graph of $q$.

\begin{proof}First, denote the optimal approximator of $g$ for tree $T$ by $f^*_T$. Recall
\[
f^*_T = f_1 \prod_{i \neq 1} f_{i \mid  \pa{i}}
\]

Second, recall $d(g, f) = H(g, f) - H(g)$.
Since $H(g)$ does not depend on $f$, $f$ is a minimizer of $d(g, f)$ if and only if it is a minimizer of $H(g, f)$.

Third, express the cross entropy of $f^*_T$ relative to $g$ as
\[
\begin{aligned}
H(q, p^*_T) &= h(q_1) - \sum_{j \neq i} ( \int_{\R ^d} g(x) \log g_{i \mid  \pa_i}(x_i, x_{\pa_i}) dx ) \\
&= H(q_1) - \sum_{i \neq 1} \sum_{a \in A} q(a) (\log q_{i,\pa_i}(a_i, a_{\pa_i}) - \log q_{\pa{i}}(a_{\pa_i})) \\
&= H(q_1) - \sum_{i \neq 1} \sum_{a \in A} q(a) (\log q_{i,\pa_i}(a_i, a_{\pa_i}) - \log q_{\pa_i}(a_{\pa_i}) - \log q_i(a_i) + \log q_{i}(a_i) ) \\
&= \sum_{i = 1}^{n} H(q_i) - \sum_{i \neq 1} I(q_i, q_{\pa_i}) \\
&= \sum_{i = 1}^{n} H(q_i) - \sum_{\set{i,j} \in T} I(q_i, q_{j}) \\
\end{aligned}
\]
where $\pa_i$ denotes the parent of vertex $i$ in $T$ ($i = 2, \dots , n$).
$H(g_i)$ does not depend on the choice of tree.
Choosing a tree to minimize the second term in the final expression above is equivalent to choosing a maximal spanning tree from the weighted graph with differential mutual information edge weights; namely, the mutual information graph of $g$.
\end{proof}
