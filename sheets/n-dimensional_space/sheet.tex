\ssection{Why}

If $\R$ corresponds to a line, and $\R^2$ to a plane, and $\R^3$ to space, does $\R^4$ correspond to anything? What of $\R^5$?

\ssection{Definition}

Let $n$ be a natural number.
We call the set $\R^n$ \t{$n$-dimensional space}.
We call elements of $\R^n$ \t{points} and call the point associated with $x = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) \in \R^n$ with $x_i = 0$ for $1 \leqq i \leqq n$ the \t{origin}.
When it is clear from context, we denote the point $x$ with $x_i = 0$ for all $i = 1, \dots, n$ by $0$.
Likewise, we denote teh point $x$ with $x_i = 1$ for all $i = 1, \dots, n$ by $1$ when it is clear from context.

\ssection{Visualization}

We can not visualize $n$-dimensional space.
Thus, our intuition for it comes from real space (see \sheetref{real_space}{Real Space}).

\ssection{Distance}

A natural notion of distance for $\R^n$ is the extension of the Euclidean distance. We define the distance between $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$, $(y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n) \in \R^n$ as
\[
  \sqrt{(x_1 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - y_2)^2 + \cdots + (x_n - y_n)^2}
\]
This is sometimes called the \t{Euclidean distance for $n$-dimensional space}.
Does this have the properties that distance has in the plane and in space?
We discussed these properties
It does.
Denote the function which associates to $x, y \in \R^n$ their distance $d: \R^n \times \R^n \to \R$.
So $d(x, y)$ is the distance between the points corresponding to $x$ and $y$.
\begin{proposition}
  $d$ is non-negative, symmetric, and the distance between two points is no larger than the sum of the distances with any third object.\footnote{Future editions will include an account.}
\end{proposition}
