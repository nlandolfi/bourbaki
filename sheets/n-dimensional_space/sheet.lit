§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ If $𝗥$ corresponds to a line, and $𝗥^2$ to a plane, and
    $𝗥^3$ to space, does $𝗥^4$ correspond to anything? What of
    $𝗥^5$? ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $n$ be a natural number. ⦉

  ‖ We call the set $𝗥^n$ ❬$n$-dimensional space❭ (or ❬Euclidean
    $n$-space❭). ⦉

  ‖ We call elements of $𝗥^n$ ❬points❭. ⦉

  ‖ We identify $𝗥^1$ with $𝗥$ in the obvious way. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We call the point associated with $x = (x_1, x_2, …, x_n)
    ∈ 𝗥^n$ with $x_i = 0$ for $1 ≦ i ≦ n$ the ❬origin❭. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the origin by $0$. ⦉

  ‖ Similarly, we denote the point $x$ with $x_i = 1$ for all
    $i = 1, …, n$ by $1$. ⦉
⦉

§ Visualization ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We can not visualize $n$-dimensional space. ⦉

  ‖ Thus, our intuition for it comes from real space (see
    \sheetref{real_space}{Real Space}). ⦉
⦉

§ Distance ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A natural notion of distance for $𝗥^n$ generalizes that in
    $𝗥^2$ and $𝗥^3$. ⦉

  ‖ We define the ❬distance❭ (❬Euclidean distance❭) between $(x_1,
    x_2, …, x_n)$, $(y_1, y_2, …, y_n) ∈ 𝗥^n$ as
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \sqrt{(x_1 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - y_2)^2 + ⋯ + (x_n -
        y_n)^2}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Does this have the properties that distance has in the
    plane and in space? ⦉

  ‖ We discussed these properties ⦉

  ‖ It does. ⦉

  ‖ Denote the function which associates to $x, y ∈ 𝗥^n$ their
    distance $d: 𝗥^n × 𝗥^n → 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ So $d(x, y)$ is the distance between the points
    corresponding to $x$ and $y$. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ $d$ is non-negative, symmetric, and the distance between two
    points is no larger than the sum of the distances with any
    third object.

§ Order ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $x, y ∈ 𝗥^n$. ⦉

  ‖ If $x_i < y_i$ for all $i = 1, …, n$ then we say $x$
    is ❬less than❭ $y$. ⦉

  ‖ Likewise, if $x_i ≤ y_i$ for all $i = 1, …, n$ then we
    say $x ≤ y$. ⦉

  ‖ Likewise for $>$ and $≥$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ If $x ∈ 𝗥^n$ is less than $y ∈ 𝗥^n$ then we write $x <
    y$. ⦉

  ‖ Similarly for $x ≤ y$, $x > y$ and $x ≥ y$. ⦉

  ‖ Other notation in the literature for $𝗥^n$ includes $E^n$,
    which is a mnemonic for “euclidean.” ⦉
