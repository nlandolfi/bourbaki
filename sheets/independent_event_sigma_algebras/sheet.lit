§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬event sigma algebra❭ of $A ∈ ℱ$ where $(Ω, ℱ)$ is a
    measurable space is the set sub-$σ$-algebra $\set{∅, A, A^c,
    Ω}$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A family of events events are ❬independent❭ if the event
    sigma algebras are independent. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ be a probability space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $A ∈ 𝒜$ be an event. ⦉

  ‖ The sigma algebra generated by $A$ is $\set*{∅, A, X - A,
    X}$. ⦉

  ‖ We denote it by $σ(A)$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $B ∈ 𝒜$. ⦉

  ‖ If $A$ is independent of $B$ we write $A ⟂ B$. ⦉
⦉

§ Equivalent condition ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Two events are independent if and only if the measure of
    their intersection is the product of their measures. ⦉
</statement>
<proof>
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ be a probability space. ⦉

    ‖ Let $A, B ∈ 𝒜$. ⦉
  ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ $(⇒)$ If $A ⟂ B$, then by definition $A ∈ σ(A)$ and $B
      ∈ σ(B)$ and so:
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ μ(A ∩ B) = μ(A)μ(B). ⦉
      ⦉⦉
  ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ $(\Leftarrow)$ Conversely, let $a ∈ σ(A)$ and $b ∈ σ(B)$. ⦉

    ‖ If $a = ∅$ or $b = ∅$ then $a ∩ b = ∅$. ⦉

    ‖ So
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ μ(a ∩ b) = μ(∅) = μ(a)μ(b), ⦉
      ⦉
      since one of the two measures on the right hand side is
      zero. ⦉

    ‖ On the other hand, if $a = X$, then $a ∩ b = b$ and
      so
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ μ(a ∩ b) = μ(b) = μ(a)μ(b), ⦉
      ⦉
      since $μ(a) = μ(X) = 1$. ⦉

    ‖ Likewise if $b = X$. ⦉
  ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ So it remains to verify $μ(a ∩ b) = μ(a)μ(b)$ for the
      cases $a ∈ \set{A,X -A}$ and $b ∈ \set{B, X-B}$. ⦉

    ‖ If $a = A$, and $b = B$, then the identity follows by
      hypothesis. ⦉

    ‖ Next, observe that $A ∩ (X - B) = A - (A ∩ B)$ and
      $(A ∩ B) ⊂ A$ so $μ(X) < ∞$ allows us to deduce:
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ \begin{aligned} ⦉

        ‖ μ(A ∩ (X - B)) ❲&❳= μ(A - (A ∩ B)) ᜶ ⦉

        ‖ ❲&❳= μ(A) - μ(A ∩ B) ᜶ ⦉

        ‖ ❲&❳= μ(A)(1 - μ(B)) ᜶ ⦉

        ‖ ❲&❳= μ(A)μ(X - A). ⦉

        ‖ \end{aligned} ⦉
      ⦉⦉

    ‖ Similar for $X-A$ and $B$. ⦉

    ‖ Finally, recall that $μ(A ∪ B) = μ(A) + μ(B) - μ(A ∩
      B)$. ⦉

    ‖ So then,
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ \begin{aligned} ⦉

        ‖ μ((X - A) ∩ (X - B)) ❲&❳= 1 - μ(A ∪ B) ᜶ ⦉

        ‖ ❲&❳= 1 - μ(A) - μ(B) + μ(A ∩ B) ᜶ ⦉

        ‖ ❲&❳= 1 - μ(A) - μ(B) + μ(A)μ(B) ᜶ ⦉

        ‖ ❲&❳= (1 - μ(A))(1 - μ(B)) ᜶ ⦉

        ‖ ❲&❳= μ(X - A)μ(X - B). ⦉

        ‖ \end{aligned} ⦉
      ⦉⦉
