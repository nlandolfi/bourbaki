§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ What does it mean for two random variables to be
    independent? ⦉

§§ Defining Result ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The set of inverse images of the measurable sets under any
    function form a sigma algebra. ⦉

  ‖ If the function is measurable, then this sigma algbera is a
    sub-$σ$-algebra of the domain sigma algebra. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Suppose $(X, 𝒜)$ and $(Y, ℬ)$ are measurable spaces and $f:
    X → Y$. ⦉

  ‖ The set $𝒞 ⊂ \powerset{X}$ defined by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ 𝒞 = \Set*{f^{-1}(B)}{B ∈ ℬ} ⦉
    ⦉
    is a $σ$-algebra. ⦉

  ‖ $f$ is measurable if and only if $𝒞 ⊂ 𝒜$. ⦉
</statement>
<proof>
  ‖ First we show that $𝒞$ is a sigma-algebra.
    𝍫 ⦊
      ‣ ‖ We claim $X ∈ 𝒞$. ⦉

        ‖ This holds because $f^{-1}(Y) = X$. ⦉⦉

      ‣ ‖ We claim
          ◇ ⦊
            ‖ X - C ∈ 𝒞 \quad \text{for all } C ∈ 𝒞 ⦉
          ⦉⦉

        ‖ To see this let $C ∈ 𝒞$. ⦉

        ‖ By definition, there exists a set $B ∈ ℬ$ of which
          $C$ is the inverse image. ⦉

        ‖ In symbols, $C = f^{-1}(B)$. ⦉

        ‖ Then $X - C = X - f^{-1}(B) = f^{-1}(Y - B)$. ⦉

        ‖ Since $ℬ$ is a sigma algebra, $B ∈ ℬ, Y - B ∈ ℬ$
          and so $X - C ∈ 𝒞$. ⦉⦉

      ‣ ‖ We claim
          ◇ ⦊
            ‖ ∪_{n = 1}^{∞} C_n ∈ 𝒞 \quad \text{for all }
              \seq{C} ⦉
          ⦉⦉

        ‖ To see this, suppose $\seq{C}$ is a sequence of sets
          in $𝒞$. ⦉

        ‖ Then for every $n$ there exists a $B_n ∈ ℬ$ so that
          $C_n = f^{-1}(B_n)$. ⦉

        ‖ Then:
          ◇ ⦊
            ‖ ∪_{n} C_n = ∪_n f^{-1}(B_n) = f^{-1}(∪ B_n). ⦉
          ⦉⦉

        ‖ Since $ℬ$ is a sigma algebra, ⦉

        ‖ $∪_n B_n ∈ ℬ$ and so $∪_{n} C_n ∈ 𝒞$. ⦉⦉
    ⦉

    ‖ We conclude that $𝒞$ is a sigma-algebra. ⦉⦉
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Next we show that $f$ is measurable if and only if $C ⊂
      𝒜$. ⦉

    ‖ The ‹if› direction is by definition. ⦉

    ‖ For the ‹only if› direction, suppose $f$ is measurable. ⦉

    ‖ Then for any $B ∈ ℬ$, we have that $f^{-1}(B) ∈ 𝒜$. ⦉

    ‖ Hence $𝒞 ⊂ 𝒜$ by definition. ⦉
  ⦉
</proof>
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The sigma algebra ❬generated by a random variable❭ is the
    sigma algebra consisting of the inverse images of every
    measurable set of the codomain. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The sigma algebra generated by a family of random variables
    is the sigma algebra generated by the union of the sigma
    algebras generated individually by each of the random
    variables. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ be a probability space and $(Y, ℬ)$ be a
    measurable space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $f: X → Y$ be a random variable. ⦉

  ‖ Denote by $σ(f)$ the sigma algebra generated by $f$. ⦉
⦉

§ Results ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>

    random variable is measurably. ⦉
