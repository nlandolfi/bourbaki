§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ What does it mean for two random variables to be
    independent? ⦉

  ‖ What are the events associated with a random variable?

§§ Defining Result ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ The set of inverse images the distinguished sets of a
      measurable space under a function from a set to that space
      is a sigma algebra. ⦉
  ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ If the first set and the function are measurable, the
      sigma algebra is a sub sigma algebra of the domain sigma
      algebra. ⦉
  ⦉

  <proof>
    ¶ ⦊
      ‖ Let $(X, \SA)$ and $(Y, \SB)$ be measurable spaces. ⦉

      ‖ Let $f: X → Y$ be a measurable function. Define
        ◇ ⦊
          ‖ \SC := \Set*{f^{-1}(B)}{B ∈ \SB}. ⦉
        ⦉⦉
    ⦉

    ¶ ⦊
      ‖ First, since $f^{-1}(Y) = X$, $X ∈ \SC$. ⦉
    ⦉

    ¶ ⦊
      ‖ Second, let $C ∈ \SC$. Then there is $B$ such that $C
        = f^{-1}(B)$. Then $X - C = X - f^{-1}(B) = f^{-1}(Y -
        B)$. ⦉

      ‖ Since $\SB$ is a sigma algebra, $B ∈ \SB, Y - B ∈
        \SB$ and so $X - C ∈ \SC$. ⦉
    ⦉

    ¶ ⦊
      ‖ Finally, let $\seq{C} ⊂ \SC$. ⦉

      ‖ Then for every $n$ there exists a $B_n ∈ \SB$ so that
        $C_n = f^{-1}(B_n)$. ⦉

      ‖ Then:
        ◇ ⦊
          ‖ \union_{n} C_n = \union_n f^{-1}(B_n) = f^{-1}(\union
            B_n). ⦉
        ⦉⦉

      ‖ Since $\SB$ is a sigma algebra, ⦉

      ‖ $\union_n B_n ∈ \SB$ and so $\union_{n} C_n ∈ \SC$. ⦉
    ⦉

    ¶ ⦊
      ‖ Since $f$ is measurable, $f^{-1}(B) ∈ \SA$ for every $B
        ∈ ℬ$, and so $𝒞 ⊂ 𝒜$. ⦉
    ⦉
  </proof>
</statement>
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The sigma algebra ❬generated by a random variable❭ is the
    sigma algebra consisting of the inverse images of every
    measurable set of the codomain. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The sigma algebra generated by a family of random variables
    is the sigma algebra generated by the union of the sigma
    algebras generated individually by each of the random
    variables. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ be a probability space and $(Y, \SB)$ be
    a measurable space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $f: X → Y$ be a random variable. ⦉

  ‖ Denote by $σ(f)$ the sigma algebra generated by $f$. ⦉
⦉

§ Results ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ The sigma algebra generated by a family of random variables
    is the smallest sigma algebra for with respect to which each
    random variable is measurably. ⦉
