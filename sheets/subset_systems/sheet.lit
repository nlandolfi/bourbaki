§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We are often interested in a set of subsets of a given
    set. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A$ be a non-empty set. ⦉

  ‖ A ❬subset system❭ (or ❬set system❭) is a pair $(A, 𝒜)$ in
    which $𝒜 ⊂ \powerset{A}$. ⦉

  ‖ In this common case we call the first set the ❬base set❭
    and the second set the ❬distinguished subsets❭. ⦉

  ‖ A subset of $B ⊂ A$ which is not ❬distinguished❭ (i.e., $B
    ∉ 𝒜$) is called ❬undistinguished❭. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='example'>
  ‖ Let $A$ be a nonempty set. ⦉

  ‖ Let $𝒜$ be $\powerset{A}$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $(A, 𝒜)$ is a subset system. ⦉
</statement>

§§ Other terminology ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Other terminology refers to $(U, ℱ)$ as a ❬set system❭ when
    $U$ is a nonempty finite set and $ℱ$ is a family of
    subsets of $U$. ⦉

  ‖ Set systems are also known as ❬hypergraphs❭. ⦉
