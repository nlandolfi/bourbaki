\ssection{Why}

We are often interested in a set of subsets of a given set.

\ssection{Definition}

Let $A$ be a non-empty set.
A \t{subset system} is a pair $(A, \CA)$ in which $\CA \subset \powerset{A}$.
In this common case we call the first set the \t{base set} and the second set the \t{distinguished subsets}.
A subset of $B \subset A$ which is not \t{distinguished} (i.e., $B \not\in \CA$) is called \t{undistinguished}.



\begin{expl}
Let $A$ be a nonempty set.
Let $\mathcal{A}$ be $\powerset{A}$.
Then $(A, \mathcal{A})$ is a subset system.
\end{expl}
