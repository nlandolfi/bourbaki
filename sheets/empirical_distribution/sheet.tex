\ssection{Why}

\ssection{Definition}

The \ct{empirical distribution}{}
of a data set is the distribution
which assign probabilities to
elements of the base set in accordance
to their proportions in the
data set.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(a^1, \dots, a^n)$ be a data set in $A$.
Let $R$ be the set of real numbers.
Let $q: A \to R$ be defined by
\[
  q(a) = \frac{1}{n} \card{\Set*{k \in \set{1, \dots, n}}{a^k = a}}
\]
Then $q$ is the empirical distribution
of $(a^1, \dots, a^n)$.
