\ssection{Why}

A natural distribution to associate
with a dataset is to assign probabilities
which are the proporitions.

\ssection{Definition}

The \ct{empirical distribution}{}
of a dataset is to assign probabilities
to outcomes in accordance to their
proportions of appearance in the dataset.
The proporitions are nonnegative
and sum to one, so this definition
yields in a probability distribution.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(a^1, \dots, a^n)$ be a data set in $A$.
Let $q: A \to \R$ be defined by
\[
  q(a) = \frac{1}{n} \card{\Set*{k \in \set{1, \dots, n}}{a^k = a}}
\]
Then $q$ is the empirical distribution
of $(a^1, \dots, a^n)$.
