§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A natural distribution to associate with a dataset is to
    assign to each outcome a probability which reflects the
    number of times it appears in the dataset. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬empirical distribution❭ of a dataset is the function
    which associates to each outcome the proportion times it
    appears in the dataset. ⦉

  ‖ Since the proporitions are nonnegative and sum to one, the
    function is a probability distribution. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A$ be a non-empty set and $(a^1, …, a^n)$ be a
    dataset in $A$. ⦉

  ‖ The empirical distribution $q: A → 𝗥$ of $(a^1, …, a^n)$
    is
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ q(a) = \frac{1}{n} \num{\Set*{k ∈ \set{1, …, n}}{a^k =
        a}}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ In other words, to give the probability of outcome $a ∈
    A$, we count the number of times it appeared in the dataset
    of size $n$, and then divide by $n$. ⦉
