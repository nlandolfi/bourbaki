§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want a set which corresponds to our notion of points on
    a line.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will modify and expand this justification. ⦉

⦉

§ Rational cuts ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We call a subset $R$ of $𝗤$ a ❬rational cut❭ if (a) $R ≠
    ∅$, (b) $R ≠ 𝗤$, (c) for all $q ∈ R$, $r ≤ q ⟹ r ∈
    R$, and (d) $R$ has no greatest element. ⦉

  ‖ Briefly, the intuition is that the point is the set of all
    rationals to less than (or, potentially, equal to) some
    particular rational number.
    † ⦊
      ‖ This brief intuition will be expanded upon in future
        sheets. ⦉

§ Definition ⦉

‖ The ❬set of real numbers❭ is the set of all rational cuts. ⦉

‖ This set exists by an application of the principle of
  selection (see␣
  <a href='/sheets/set_selection.html'>
    ‖ Set Selection ⦉
  </a>
  ) to the power set (see␣
  <a href='/sheets/set_powers.html'>
    ‖ Set Powers ⦉
  </a>
  ) of $𝗤$. ⦉

‖ We call an element of the set of real numbers a ❬real
  number❭ or a ❬real❭. ⦉

‖ We call the set of real numbers the ❬set of reals❭ or
  ❬reals❭ for short. ⦉

§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We follow tradition and denote the set of real numbers by
    $𝗥$, likely a mnemonic for “real.” ⦉
⦉

§§ Other terminology ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Some authors call a real number a ❬quantity❭ or a
    ❬continuous quantity❭. ⦉

  ‖ The real numbers, then, are said to be ❬continuous❭. ⦉

  ‖ When contrasting (using this terminology) a finite set with
    the real numbers, one refers to the finite set as
    ❬discrete❭.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions may move this discussion later, to the
        discussion of the cardinality of the reals. ⦉
