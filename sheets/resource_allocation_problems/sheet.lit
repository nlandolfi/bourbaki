§ Why
  † ⦊
    ‖ Future editions will include. For now this sheet serves as
      an example of a continuous optimization problem. ⦉
  ⦉⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to allocate a resource among $n$ entities to
    maximize some measure of “return” or “profit.” ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $B ∈ 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $R_i: 𝗥 → 𝗥$ be a function which gives the return for
    allocating entity $i$ the amount $x_i$ of the resource. ⦉

  ‖ Let $𝒳 = \Set*{x ∈ 𝗥^n}{x ≥ 0, ∑_i x_i = B}$ ⦉

  ‖ Define $f: 𝗥^n → 𝗥$ by $f(x) = ∑_{i = 1}^{n} R_i(x_i)$. ⦉

  ‖ We call the optimization problem $(𝒳, f)$ a ❬single-resource
    allocation problem❭. ⦉

  ‖ In this case we call $x ∈ 𝗥^{n}$ an ❬allocation❭ and we
    call $B$ the ❬budget❭. ⦉
