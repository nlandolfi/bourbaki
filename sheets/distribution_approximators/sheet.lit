§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We have a distribution to approximate. ⦉

  ‖ It is, for some reason, unsuitable to our needs and we
    want to replace it with one more suitable. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬distribution approximator❭ is an approximator of a
    probability distribution. ⦉

  ‖ It is also a distribution. ⦉

  ‖ The criterion of approximation is any similarity function on
    distributions over the same space. ⦉
⦉

§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A$ be a non-empty set and $q: A → 𝗥$ be a
    distribution. ⦉

  ‖ Let $p: A → 𝗥$ be a distribution. ⦉

  ‖ Then $p: A → 𝗥$ is a distribution approximator of $q$. ⦉
⦉

§ Reasons for approximation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ ⦉

  ‖ «Infeasible to represent.» ⦉

  ‖ If there are many outcomes, many numbers are required to
    specify the distribution. ⦉

  ‖ If $p: A^n → 𝗥$ where $|A| = k$, then there are $k^n$
    outcomes; take, for example, $k = 2$ and $n = 100$. ⦉

  ‖ So we might want to find a distribution which requires
    fewer numbers to express. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, we want a different distribution, selected
    from the set of those which is easier to express, which is
    close to the original. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ «Unreasonable from common sense.» ⦉

  ‖ The distribution may be unreasonable as a result of our
    common sense. ⦉

  ‖ For example, it may give zero probability to an outcome
    which we know to be possible, and would like to model with
    non-zero probability. ⦉

  ‖ This may happen when working with an empirical distribution:
    a particular outcome does not appear in the dataset, however,
    our common sense suggests is possible. ⦉

  ‖ In this case, we want to find a different distribution,
    selected from the set of those which is more reasonable
    based on common sense, which is close to the original. ⦉
