\section*{Why}

Suppose we flip a coin until it lands heads.
What is the probability that we see a head after one flip?
Two flips?
$n$ flips?
We want to extend our notion of probability distribution to a set with infinite elements, but only countably many.

\section*{Discussion}

Consider a set $A$.
  \ifhmode\unskip\fi\footnote{
Future editions will rework this sheet.
  }
If $A$ has $n$ elements, then a probability distribution on $A$ is $p: A \to \R $ where $p(a) = 1/n$.
There is a natural candidate.

What if $A$ is the set of natural numbers $\N $.
The principle difficulty is that not all sequences
of real numbers $a: \N  \to \R $ are summable.

\section*{Definition}

A \t{(countable) probability distribution} on $\N $ is $p: \N \to \R $ where $p \geq 0$ and
  \[
\textstyle
\sum_{n =1}^{\infty} p(n) = 1.
  \]
