\ssection{Why}

We want to extend our notion
of probability distribution to
a set with infinite elements,
but only countably many.

\ssection{Why}

Consider a set $A$. If $A$
has $n$ elements, then a probability
distribution on $A$ is $p: A \to \R$
where $p(a) = 1/n$. There is a natural
candidate.

What if $A$ is the set of natural numbers $\N$.
The principle difficulty is that not all sequences
of real numbers $a: \N \to \R$ are summable.

A \ct{(countable) probability distribution}{}
on $\N$ is $p: \N \to \R$ where $p \geq 0$ and
\[
  \sum_{n =1}^{\infty} p(n) = 1.
\]
