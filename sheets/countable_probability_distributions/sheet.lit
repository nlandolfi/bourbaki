  ‖ Suppose we flip a coin until it lands heads. ⦉

  ‖ What is the probability that we see a head after one flip? ⦉

  ‖ Two flips? ⦉

  ‖ $n$ flips? ⦉

  ‖ We want to extend our notion of probability distribution to
    a set with infinite elements, but only countably many. ⦉

  ‖ If $A$ has $n$ elements, then a probability distribution on
    $A$ is $p: A → 𝗥$ where $p(a) = 1∕n$. ⦉

  ‖ There is a natural candidate. ⦉
