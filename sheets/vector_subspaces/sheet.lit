§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬subspace❭ (or ❬linear subspace❭, ❬vector subspace❭) of a
    vector space is a subset of vectors that is a vector space
    when restriction vector addition and scalar multiplication to
    the set. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, a subspace is a subset of a vector space
    which is closed under vector addition and scalar
    multiplication. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ For example, the entire set of vectors is a subspace. ⦉

  ‖ As a second example, the set consisting only of the zero
    vector is a subspace; we call this the ❬zero subspace❭. ⦉

  ‖ These two subspaces are the ❬trivial subspaces❭. ⦉

  ‖ A ❬nontrivial subspace❭ is a subspace that is not trivial. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(V, 𝗙)$ be a vector space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $U ⊂ V$ with
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ α u + β v ∈ U ⦉
    ⦉
    for all $α, β ∈ 𝗙$ and $u, v ∈ U$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $U$ is a subspace of $(V, 𝗙)$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Characterization ⦉

<!-- the following is 1.34 of axler -->
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Suppose $V$ is a vector space over a field $𝗙$ and $U ⊂
    V$. ⦉

  ‖ $U$ is a subspace if and only if $U$ satisifes
    𝍫 ⦊
      ‣ $0 ∈ U$ (contains additive identity) ⦉

      ‣ $u + w ∈ U$ for all $u, w ∈ U$ (closed under
        addition) ⦉

      ‣ $αu ∈ U$ for all $α ∈ 𝗙$ and $u ∈ U$ (closed under
        scalar addition) ⦉

§ Properties ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ The intersection of a family of subspaces is a subspace. ⦉
</statement>
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ There exists a family of subspaces whose union is not a
    subspace; ⦉
  <statement type='remark'>
    ‖ In other words: the union of a family subspaces need not
      be a subspace. ⦉
  </statement>
</statement>
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ A subspace must contain the zero vector; in other words,
    every subspace is nonempty. ⦉
