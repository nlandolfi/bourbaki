§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to order the rationals. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Consider $\eqc{(a, b)}, \eqc{(b, c)} ∈ 𝗤$ with $0_{𝗭} < b,
    d$ ⦉

  ‖ If $ad < bc$, then we say that $\eqc{(a, b)}$ is ❬less
    than❭ $\eqc{(b, c)}$.
    † ⦊
      ‖ One needs to show that this is well-defined. The account
        will appear in future editions. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ If $\eqc{(a, b)}$ is less than $\eqc{(b, c)}$ or equal,
    then we say that $\eqc{(a, b)}$ is ❬less than or equal to❭
    $\eqc{(b, c)}$. ⦉

§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ If $x, y ∈ 𝗤$ and $x$ is less than $y$, then we write
    $x < y$. ⦉

  ‖ If $x$ is less than or equal to $y$, we write $x ≤ y$. ⦉
