\ssection{Why}

The entire functions \say{extend} the polynomial functions.
For polynomial in $\C$, we can extend the class to the (complex) rational functions in $\C$.
Can we similarly extend the class entire functions?\footnote{Future editions may modify.}

\ssection{Definition}

A \t{meromorphic function} (or \t{fractional function}) is a function $f: \C \to \C$ for which there exists entire functions $g: \C \to \C$ and $h: \C \to \C$ so that
\[
  f(z) = \frac{g(z)}{h(z)}
\]
for all $z \in \C$.\footnote{Future editions will continue the development.}
