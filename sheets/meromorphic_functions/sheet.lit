§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The entire functions “extend” the polynomial functions. ⦉

  ‖ For polynomial in $𝗖$, we can extend the class to the
    (complex) rational functions in $𝗖$. ⦉

  ‖ Can we similarly extend the class entire functions?

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬meromorphic function❭ (or ❬fractional function❭) is a
    function $f: 𝗖 → 𝗖$ for which there exists entire functions
    $g: 𝗖 → 𝗖$ and $h: 𝗖 → 𝗖$ so that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ f(z) = \frac{g(z)}{h(z)} ⦉
    ⦉
    for all $z ∈ 𝗖$.
