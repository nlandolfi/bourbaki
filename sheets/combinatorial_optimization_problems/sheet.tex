\section*{Why}

Often the feasible set of an optimization problem is set with many, say $2^{100}$, objects.
Often the size grows exponential in the size of the representation.

\section*{Definition}

An optimization problem $(\mathcal{X} , f)$ is called a \t{combinatorial} (a \t{combinatorial optimization problem}) if $\mathcal{X} $ is a finite set.
Usually, the language is meant to connote that the set is large, with respect to some predetermined notion of size.
