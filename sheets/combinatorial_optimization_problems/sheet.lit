§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Often the feasible set of an optimization problem is set
    with many, say $2^{100}$, objects. ⦉

  ‖ Often the size grows exponential in the size of the
    representation. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ An optimization problem $(𝒳, f)$ is called a ❬combinatorial❭
    (a ❬combinatorial optimization problem❭) if $𝒳$ is a finite
    set. ⦉

  ‖ Usually, the language is meant to connote that the set is
    large, with respect to some predetermined notion of size. ⦉
