\ssection{Why}\footnote{Future editions will include. For now this is an example of a discrete optimization problem.}

\ssection{Definition}

Suppose we want to find the shortest path on a weighted graph from a given starting vertex to a given terminal vertex.

Let $((V, E), w: E \to \R)$ be a weighted directed graph.
Let $v$ be a source and $w$ be a sink.
Let $\CX$ denote the set of (directed) paths from $v$ to $w$.
Let $f: \CX \to \R$ be so that if $x \in X$ is a path from $v$ to $w$, then $f(x)$ is the weight of the path.
In other words, $f(x)$ is the sum of weights on the edges.
Then we call the problem $(\CX, f)$ a \t{directed shortest path problem}.
