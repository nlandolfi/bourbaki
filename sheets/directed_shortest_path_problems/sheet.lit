§ Why ⦉
† ⦊
  ‖ Future editions will include. For now this is an example of
    a discrete optimization problem. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose we want to find the shortest path on a weighted
    graph from a given starting vertex to a given terminal
    vertex. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $((V, E), w: E → 𝗥)$ be a weighted directed graph. ⦉

  ‖ Let $v$ be a source and $w$ be a sink. ⦉

  ‖ Let $𝒳$ denote the set of (directed) paths from $v$ to $w$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $f: 𝒳 → 𝗥$ be so that if $x ∈ X$ is a path from
    $v$ to $w$, then $f(x)$ is the weight of the path. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, $f(x)$ is the sum of weights on the edges. ⦉

  ‖ Then we call the problem $(𝒳, f)$ a ❬directed shortest path
    problem❭. ⦉
