§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want a norm on the space of measures. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬total variation❭ of finite measure is the variation
    measure of the base set. ⦉

  ‖ We show below that the total variation is a norm on the
    vector space of finite measures. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜)$ be a measurable space and $μ: X → 𝗥$ be a
    finite signed measure. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the total variation by $\tvnorm{μ}$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $\vmeas{μ}$ be the variation of $μ$. ⦉

  ‖ Then, $\tvnorm{μ} = \vmeas{μ}(X)$. ⦉
