\section*{Why}

We want a norm on the space of measures.

\section*{Definition}

The \t{total variation} of finite measure is the variation measure of the base set.
We show below that the total variation is a norm on the vector space of finite measures.

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $(X, \mathcal{A} )$ be a measurable space and $\mu : X \to \R $ be a finite signed measure.
We denote the total variation by $\tvnorm{\mu }$.

Let $\vmeas{\mu }$ be the variation of $\mu $.
Then, $\tvnorm{\mu } = \vmeas{\mu }(X)$.
