\ssection{Why}

We can view the set of real-valued $n \times k$ matrices as a vector space over $\R$.

\ssection{Definition}

The \t{matrix sum} of two matrices $A, B \in \R^{n \times k}$ is the matrix $C \in \R^{n \times k}$ defined by $C_{ij} = A_{ij} + B_{ij}$.
In other words, the matrix $C$ is given by summing the entires of $A$ and $B$ \say{entry-wise}.
We denote the matrix sum by $A + B$.

For $\alpha \in \R$, the \t{$\alpha$-scaled version} of $A \in \R^{n \times k}$ is the matrix $C \in \R^{n \times k}$ given by $C_{ij} = \alpha A_{ij}$.
In other words, the matrix $C$ is given by scaling the entries of $A$ \say{entry-wise}.
We denote the $\alpha$-scaled version of $A$ by $\alpha A$.
These two definitions are justified by the following.

The \t{$n \times k$-matrix space} is the vector space over $\R^{n \times k}$ in which addition is given by the matrix sumer and scalar multiplication by entry-wise scaling.\footnote{Future editions will rework this sheet.}


\ssubsection{Subspace of symmetric matrices}

The subset of symmetric $n$ by $n$ matrices is a subset of $\R^{n \times n}$.
