§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We can view the set of real-valued $n ×k$ matrices as a
    vector space over $𝗥$. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬matrix sum❭ of two matrices $A, B ∈ 𝗥^{n ×k}$ is the
    matrix $C ∈ 𝗥^{n ×k}$ defined by $C_{ij} = A_{ij} + B_{ij}$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, the matrix $C$ is given by summing the
    entires of $A$ and $B$ “entry-wise}. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the matrix sum by $A + B$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ For $α ∈ 𝗥$, the ❬$α$-scaled version❭ of $A ∈ 𝗥^{n ×k}$
    is the matrix $C ∈ 𝗥^{n ×k}$ given by $C_{ij} = α A_{ij}$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, the matrix $C$ is given by scaling the
    entries of $A$ “entry-wise”. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the $α$-scaled version of $A$ by $α A$. ⦉

  ‖ These two definitions are justified by the following. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬$n ×k$-matrix space❭ is the vector space over $𝗥^{n ×
    k}$ in which addition is given by the matrix sumer and
    scalar multiplication by entry-wise scaling.

§§ Subspace of symmetric matrices ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The subset of symmetric $n$ by $n$ matrices is a subset of
    $𝗥^{n ×n”$. ⦉
