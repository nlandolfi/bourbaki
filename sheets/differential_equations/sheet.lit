§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to model physical phenomena. ⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬differential equation❭ is an equation relating functions
    and their derivatives. ⦉
⦉

§ Basic example ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ For example, let $f: 𝗥 → 𝗥$ be differentiable everywhere
    and denote the derivative of $f$ by $f': 𝗥 → 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ Suppose that there exists $α ∈ 𝗥$ so that for all $x ∈
    𝗥$,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ f'(x) = α f(x). ⦉

§ Solutions ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬solution❭ of a differential equation is a function (or
    functions) which satisfy the equation.
