\ssection{Why}

We want to model physical phenomena.

\ssection{Definition}

A \t{differential equation} is an equation relating functions and their derivatives.

\ssection{Basic Example}

For example, let $f: \R \to \R$ be differentiable everywhere and denote the derivative of $f$ by $f': \R \to \R$.
Suppose that there exists $\alpha \in \R$ so that for all $x \in \R$,
\[
  f'(x) = \alpha f(x).
\]

\ssection{Solutions}

The \t{solution} of a differential equation is a function (or functions) which satisfy the equation.\footnote{Future editions will expand.}
