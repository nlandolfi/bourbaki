§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Two subspaces $S, T ⊂ 𝗥^n$ are ❬orthogonal❭ if
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ x^\tp y = 0 \text{ for all } x ∈ S, y ∈ T. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ For any set $S ⊂ 𝗥^n$ (not necessarily a subspace), the
    ❬orthogonal complement❭ of $S$ is the set
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ S^⊥ = \Set{x ∈ 𝗥^n}{x^⊤ y = 0 \text{ for all } y ∈
        S}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ $S^⊥$ is the set of all vectors which are orthogonal to
    every vector in $S$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Orthgonal complement is a subspace ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Notice that $S^⊥$ is always a subspace. ⦉

  ‖ If $x ∈ S^⊥$, then $x^⊤ y = 0$ for all $y ∈ S$. ⦉

  ‖ So then $(αx)^⊤ y = α(x^⊤ y) = 0$ for all $α ∈ 𝗥$ and
    $y ∈ S$. ⦉

  ‖ We conclude $αx ∈ S^⊥$ for all $α ∈ 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, $S^⊥$ is closed under scalar multiplication. ⦉

  ‖ If $x, z ∈ S^⊥$, then $(x+z)^⊤ y = x^⊤ y + z^⊤ y = 0
    + 0 = 0$. ⦉

  ‖ We conclude that $x + z ∈ S^⊥$ for all $x, z ∈ S^⊥$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, $S^⊥$ is closed under vector addition. ⦉

  ‖ Consequently, $S^⊥$ is a subspace. ⦉
