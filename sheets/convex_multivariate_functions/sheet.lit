§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We generalize convex functions to $𝗥^n$. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given a set $S ⊂ 𝗥^n$ and a function $f: S → \Rbar$, the
    set
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \Set{(x, α) ∈ S × 𝗥}{f(x) ≤ α} ⊂ 𝗥^{n+1} ⦉
    ⦉
    is called the ❬epigraph❭ of $f$ and is denoted by $\epi f$. ⦉

  ‖ The epigraph is a subset of $𝗥^{n+1}$. ⦉

  ‖ Recall that $\Rbar = 𝗥 ∪ \set{-∞, +∞}$ denotes the extended
    real numbers. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The function $f$ is ❬convex❭ if $\epi f$ is a convex
    subset of $𝗥^{n+1}$. ⦉

  ‖ $f$ is ❬concave❭ if $-f$ is convex. ⦉

  ‖ $f$ is ❬affine❭ if it is finite, convex and concave. ⦉

§§ Effective Domains ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $f: S → 𝗥$ is convex. ⦉

  ‖ Since our definition of epigraph restricts the last
    coordinate to be real, no points $x ∈ S$ for which $f(x) =
    +∞$ are “included” in the epigraph. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬effective domain❭ (or just ❬domain❭) of a convex
    function $f: S → \Rbar$ is the linear projection of the
    first $n$ coordinates of $\epi f$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \dom f = \Set{x ∈ S}{∃ α ∈ 𝗥, (x, α) ∈ \epi f} =
        \Set{x ∈ S}{f(x) < +∞} ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ If we define the linear projection (canonical projection) $π:
    𝗥^{n +1} → 𝗥$ by $π(x,α) = x$ where $x ∈ 𝗥^{n+1}$ and $α
    ∈ 𝗥^n$, then
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \dom f = π(\epi f) ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Since $π$ is linear and $\epi f$ is convex by assumption,
    $\dom f$ is ‹convex›. ⦉

  ‖ To say this again, the effective domain of a convex
    function is convex. ⦉

  <!-- todo: prove earlier in sheets -->

  <!-- see rockafeller 23 for more on why we have effective domains -->
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Notice that the restriction $f_{|\dom f}$ has the same
    epigraph as $f$. ⦉

  ‖ For this reason, $f$ is convex if and only if $f_{|\dom
    f}$ is convex. ⦉

  ‖ Clearly then $f$ restricted to its domain is the principal
    object of interest. ⦉

  ‖ The usefulness of these technicalities is that any convex
    $f: S → \Rbar$ can be extended to a convex function
    $\bar{f}: 𝗥^n → \Rbar$ with the same effective domain. ⦉

  ‖ Define $\bar{f}$ so that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \bar{f}(x) = ⦉

      ‖ \begin{cases} ⦉

      ‖ f(x) & x ∈ S ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ +∞ & \text{otherwise} ⦉

      ‖ \end{cases} ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Henceforth, by ❬convex function❭ will be understood an
    extended real value function, possibly taking value $+∞$,
    defined on all of $𝗥^n$ whose epigraph is convex. ⦉

  ‖ The upshot is that in constructing a convex function from
    other convex functions, the effective domains are specified
    implicitly. ⦉

  <!--
 <div data-littype='run'> Let $A$ be a convex subset of $𝗥^n$. </div>
 <div data-littype='run'> The function $f: A → 𝗥$ is ❬convex❭ if for any $a, b ∈
    A$ and $t ∈ [0, 1]$,
    <div data-littype='displaymath'>
     <div data-littype='run'> f(ta + (1-t)b) ≤ tf(a) + (1-t)f(b). </div>
    </div></div>

 <div data-littype='run'> It is ❬concave❭ if $-f$ is convex. </div>
</div>

§§ Proper convex functions ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A convex function $f$ is ❬proper❭ if there exists $x$ such
    that $f(x) < ∞$ and $f(x) > ∞$ for all $x ∈ 𝗥^n$. ⦉

  ‖ Roughly speaking, $f$ is proper if its epigraph is nonempty
    and contains no vertical lines. ⦉

  ‖ $f$ is proper if and only if $\dom f$ is nonempty and
    $f_{|\dom f}$ is finite. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The proper convex functions arise naturally by taking a
    function $f: C → 𝗥$ defined on a convex subset $C ⊂ 𝗥^n$
    and extending it to have value $+∞$ outside of $C$. ⦉

  ‖ A convex function which is not proper is ❬improper❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Of course, proper convex functions are our main object of
    study, but improper ones arise from time to time and it is
    more convenient to admit them than exclude them. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ For an example of an improper convex function, define $f:
    𝗥^n → 𝗥$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ f(x) = \begin{cases} ⦉

      ‖ -∞ & \text{ if } \norm{x} < 1, ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ 0 & \text{ if } \norm{x} = 1, ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ +∞ & \text{ if } \norm{x} > 1, ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ \end{cases} ⦉
