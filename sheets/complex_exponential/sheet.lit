§ Definition
  † ⦊
    ‖ Future editions may modify this sheet, as there are
      several (equivalent) characterizations of the complex
      exponential function. ⦉
  ⦉⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬complex exponential❭ of a complex number $z ∈ 𝗖$ is
    the complex number
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ 1 + z + \frac{z^2}{2} + \frac{z^3}{3!} + ⋯ = ∑_{n =
        1}^{∞}\frac{z^n}{n!}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the complex exponential funciton $\exp: 𝗖 → 𝗖$,
    and so denote the complex exponential of $z ∈ 𝗖$ by
    $\exp(z)$, as usual. ⦉

  ‖ This overloaded notation is justified by the fact that the
    complex exponential agrees with the real exponential function
    on reals. ⦉

  ‖ It is also common to denote $\exp(z)$ by $e^z$. ⦉

§ Relation to power series of $\sin$ and $\cos$ ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ It can be shown
    † ⦊
      ‖ And future editions will show it ⦉
    ⦉
    that for $x ∈ 𝗥$,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \exp(ix) = \cos(x) + i \sin(x). ⦉
