\section*{Definition\footnote{Future editions may modify this sheet, as there are several (equivalent) characterizations of the complex exponential function.}}

The \t{complex exponential} of a complex number $z \in \C $ is the complex number
\[
1 + z + \frac{z^2}{2} + \frac{z^3}{3!} + \cdots = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\frac{z^n}{n!}.
\]

\subsection*{Notation}

We denote the complex exponential funciton $\exp: \C  \to \C $, and so denote the complex exponential of $z \in \C $ by $\exp(z)$, as usual.
This overloaded notation is justified by the fact that the complex exponential agrees with the real exponential function on reals.
It is also common to denote $\exp(z)$ by $e^z$.

\section*{Relation to power series of $\sin$ and $\cos$}

It can be shown\footnote{And future editions will show it}
that for $x \in \R $,
\[
\exp(ix) = \cos(x) + i \sin(x).
\]
