§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $T ∈ ℒ(V, W)$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, $T$ is a linear map from a vector space
    $V$ to a vector space $W$ where $V$ and $W$ are over the
    same field of scalars. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ An ❬adjoint❭ of $T$ is a function $S: W → V$ satisfying
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \ip{Tv, w} = \ip{v, Sw} \quad \text{for every } v ∈ V
        \text{ and every } w ∈ W ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ It is not hard to see that there always exists an adjoint,
    and that this adjoint is unique. ⦉

  ‖ Thus, we speak of ❬the adjoint❭ of $T$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote ‹the› adjoint of $T$ by $T^*$. ⦉

  ‖ This notation is meant to remind of complex conjugation, for
    reasons which will become apparent shortly. ⦉
⦉

§§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ ‹Space to the plane.› ⦉

  ‖ Define $T: 𝗥^3 → 𝗥^2$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ T(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x_2 + 3x_3, 2x_1) ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ We claim that the adjoint of $T$ is $T^*: 𝗥^2 → 𝗥^3$
    defined by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ T^*(y_1, y_2) = (2y_2, y_1, 3y_1) ⦉
