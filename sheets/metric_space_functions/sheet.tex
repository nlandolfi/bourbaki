\ssection{Why}

We want to talk about functions
from one set with a metric
into another set with a metric.

\ssection{Definition}

A \ct{function}{metricspacefunction}
from a first metric space to a second
metric space is a function from
the first set to the second set.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(A, d)$ and $(B, d')$
We denote that $f$ is a function
from the first metric space to
the second metric space by
$f: (A, d) \to (B, d')$.
