§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Since we have a partial order on the set of positive
    semidefinite matrices, we can study which familiar functions
    are have order-preserving or order-reversing properties. ⦉
⦉

§ Norms ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ It would be nice if the matrix norm induced by the matrix
    scalar produce (see␣<a href="/sheets/matrix_scalar_product.html"> ‖ Matrix Scalar
    Product⦉ </a>) was an isotonic function. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, if $A, B ∈ 𝗦^d$ satisfy $A ≥ B$, does
    $\norm{A} ≥ \norm{B}$? ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Since $\norm{A}^2 = \tr A^2$, we should study the trace
    first.. ⦉
⦉

§§ Trace ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Let $f: 𝗦^d → 𝗥$ defined by $f(A) = \tr A$. ⦉
</statement>
¶ ⦊
  ‖ In other words, the function $f$ is the restriction of the
    trace function onto the set of symmetric matrices. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Let $B ∈ 𝗦^d$ ⦉

  ‖ Let $f_B: 𝗦^d → 𝗥$ defined by $f(A) = \tr AB$. ⦉
</statement>

§ Inversion ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Let $A ∈ 𝗦_{++}^d$. ⦉

  ‖ Then the map $f: 𝗦_{++}^d → 𝗦_{++}^d$ satisfying $f(A)
    =A^{-1}$ is an isotonic function mapping the (open) positive
    definite cone into itself.
