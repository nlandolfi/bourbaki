\section{Definition}

A \t{$d$-dimensional rooted tree linear cascade} is a sequence of four objects: a tree on $\set{1, \dots, d}$, a vertex of the tree, a family of real numbers indexed by the edges of the tree, and a $d$-dimensional random vector whose covariance matrix is the identity matrix.
The cascade is called \say{$d$-dimensional} because we associate it with a random vector (defined as a function of that in the form of its definition) whose codomain is  $\R^d$.

The tree together with the vertex form a rooted tree.
The graph associated with the rooted tree and the family of real numbers together form a weighted graph.

The idea is to use the weights and the tree structure to recursively define a random vector in terms of elements of the given random vector.
Let $C = (T, i, w, e)$ be a $d$-dimensional rooted tree linear cascade.
So $T$ is a tree on $\set{1, \dots, d}$, $i \in \set{1, \dots, d}$ and $w: T \to \R$, and $e: \Omega \to \R^d$ for some probability space $(A, \CA, \PM)$.
The random vector associated with $C$ is the random variable $x: \Omega \to \R^d$ defined by
$$
  x_i = e_i \text{ and } x_j = w_{\set{\pa{j}, j}}x_{\pa{j}} + e_{j} \text{ for } j \neq i.
$$
In other words,
$$
  e = Ax
$$
where $A$ is lower triangle and extremely sparse.

Let $(A, \CA, \PM)$ be a probability space.
Let $e: A \to \R^d$ be a random vector, let $T$ be a tree on $\set{1, \dots, d}$ with $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$ the weight on edge $\set{i, j} \in T$.
