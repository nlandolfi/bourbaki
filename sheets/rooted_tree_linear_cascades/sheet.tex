\section{Definition}

A \t{rooted tree linear cascade} is an ordered pair: the first object is a rooted weighted tree; the second is a random vector whose covariance is the identity matrix.
We call the random vector the noise.
Given a rooted tree linear cascade, we define a random vector whose component at the root is the is defined to be the cascade's random
We def
A rooted tre
To a rooted tree linear cascade corresponds a random vector

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(A, \CA, \P)$ be a probability space.
Let $e: A \to \R^d$ be a random vector, let $T$ be a tree on $\set{1, \dots, d}$ with $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$ the weight on edge $\set{i, j} \in T$.
