§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ What is the range of a linear transformation? ⦉

  ‖ And when is that transformation ❬onto❭? ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ For a ‹linear› transformation $T ∈ ℒ(V, W)$, we refer to
    $\range(T)$ as the ❬range space❭ (or ❬image space❭) of $T$. ⦉

  ‖ The language is justified by the following proposition. ⦉
⦉

<!-- this is 3.19 of axler -->
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Suppose $T ∈ ℒ(V, W)$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $\range T$ is a subspace of $W$. ⦉
</statement>
<proof>
  ‖ We will show that $\range(T)$ both (a) contains $0 ∈ W$
    and (b) is closed under vector addition and scalar
    multiplication. ⦉
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ For any linear map we have $T(0) = 0$, since scalar
      multipliciation commutes with the application of $T$. ⦉

    ‖ (We can express the origin $0 ∈ W$ as the scalar $0$
      times the origin.) ⦉

    ‖ Hence, the origin in $V$ is mapped to the origin in $W$
      and so $0 ∈ W$. ⦉
  ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ To see that $W$ is closed under vector addition, let
      $w_1, w_2 ∈ \range T ⊂ W$ ⦉

    ‖ Then there exists $v_1, v_2 ∈ V$ so that
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ Tv_1 = w_1 \text{ and } Tv_2 = w_2 ⦉
      ⦉⦉

    ‖ We conclude
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ w_1 + w_2 = Tv_1 + Tv_2 = T(v_1 + v_2) ⦉
      ⦉⦉

    ‖ We have written the vector $w_1 + w_2$ as the image of
      the vector $v_1 + v_2$, and so $w_1 + w_2 ∈ \range T$. ⦉

    ‖ Since $w_1$ and $w_2$ were arbitrary, we conclude that $W$
      is closed under ‹vector addition›. ⦉
  ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Similarly, to see that $W$ is closed under scalar
      multiplication, let $w ∈ \range T$ and $λ ∈ 𝗙$. ⦉

    ‖ Here $𝗙$ denotes the field over $W$ and $V$. ⦉

    ‖ Then there exists $v ∈ V$ satisfying $w = Tv$. ⦉

    ‖ We claim
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ λw = λT(v) = T(λv) ⦉
      ⦉⦉

    ‖ The second equality holds because $T$ commutes with scalar multiplication. ⦉

    ‖ Since $w$ and $λ$ were arbitrary, we conclude that $W$ is
      closed under ‹scalar multiplication›. ⦉
