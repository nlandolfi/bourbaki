§§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Matrices that have reflected values across their diagonals
    arise often.

§§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A square matrix is ❬symmetric❭ (we call it a ❬symmetric
    matrix❭) if its values do not depend on the order of the
    indices. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, a matrix is symmetric if the value above
    and below the diagonal are a mirror image. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $S$ be a nonempty set and $A ∈ S^{n × n}$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $A$ is symmetric if $A_{ij} = A_{ji}$. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the set of real-valued $n$ by $n$ symmetric
    matrices by $𝗦^n$. ⦉

  ‖ A symmetric matrix is the same as its tranpose. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, if $A$ is symmetric, $A = A^⊤$. ⦉
