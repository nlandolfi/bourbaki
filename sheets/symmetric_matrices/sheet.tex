\subsection*{Why}

Matrices that have reflected values across their diagonals arise often.\footnote{Future editions will clarify.}

\subsection*{Definition}

A square matrix is \t{symmetric} (we call it a \t{symmetric matrix}) if its values do not depend on the order of the indices.
In other words, a matrix is symmetric if the value above and below the diagonal are a mirror image.

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $S$ be a nonempty set and $A \in S^{n \times  n}$.
Then $A$ is symmetric if $A_{ij} = A_{ji}$.
We denote the set of real-valued $n$ by $n$ symmetric matrices by $\mathbfsf{S} ^n$.
A symmetric matrix is the same as its tranpose.
In other words, if $A$ is symmetric, $A = A^\top $.
