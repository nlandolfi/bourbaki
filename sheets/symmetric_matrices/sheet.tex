\ssubsection{Why}

Matrices that have reflected values
across their diagonals arise often.

\ssubsection{Definition}

A square real-valued matrix is symmetric if its values do not depend on the order of the indices.
In other words, a real-valued matrix is symmetric if the value above and below the diagonal are a mirror image.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $A \in \R^{n \times n}
