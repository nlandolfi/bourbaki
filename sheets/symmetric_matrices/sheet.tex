\ssubsection{Why}

Matrices that have reflected values
across their diagonals arise often.

\ssubsection{Definition}

A square matrix is \t{symmetric} if its values do not depend on the order of the indices.
In other words, a matrix is symmetric if the value above and below the diagonal are a mirror image.


\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $S$ be a nonempty set and $A \in \Mat{S}{n}{n}$.
Then $A$ is symmetric if $A_{ij} = A_{ji}$.
We denote the set of real-valued $n$ by $n$
symmetric matrices by $\SymMat{n}$.
