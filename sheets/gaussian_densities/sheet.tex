\ssection{Why}

We want a density that is
symmetric about some central
value with some spread.

\ssection{Definition}

Let $R$ denote the set of real numbers.
Let $\mu \in R$, let $\sigma \in R$
with $\sigma > 0$.

Then $f: R \to R$ is a \ct{gaussian density}{}
if
\[
  f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}\exp\left(\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(x - \mu)^2\right)
\]
