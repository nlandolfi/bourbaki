\ssection{Why}

We want a density that is
symmetric about some central
value with some spread.

\ssection{Definition}

Let $f: \R \to \R$ be a density.
If there exists $\mu \in \R$
and $\sigma \in \R$ with $\sigma > 0$
so that for each $x \in \R$
\[
  f(x) = \gaussiandensity{x}{\mu}{\sigma}
\]
then $f$ is a \ct{gaussian density}{}.
