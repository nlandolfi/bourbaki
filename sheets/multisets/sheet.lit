§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We often want to discuss lists without regard to order. ⦉

  ‖ This is natural, for instance, in discussing number
    factorizations. ⦉

  ‖ There, the associativity and commutativity of natural
    multipliciation mean that the factorization $(2, 3)$ and
    $(3,2)$ are equivalent, in the sense that they both factor 6. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given a set $A$, a ❬multiset❭ (or ❬mset❭) of elements ‹of›
    or ‹in› $A$ is a function $m: A → 𝗡$. ⦉

  ‖ In this case, the result $m(a)$ is called the ❬multiplicity❭
    of $a ∈ A$. ⦉

  ‖ For this reason, another term for the object we have named
    a multiset is ❬multiplicity function❭. ⦉

  ‖ An $a ∈ A$ with $m(a) ≠ 0$ is called an ❬element❭ of the
    multiset. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬size❭ (or ❬cardinality❭) of a multiset $m$ is the sum
    of the multiplicities of its elements. ⦉

  ‖ In summation notation, the size is defined to be
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ ∑_{a ∈ A} m(a) ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The set
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \Set{a ∈ A}{m(a) > 0} ⦉
    ⦉
    is called the ❬support❭ of the multiset. ⦉
⦉

§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A natural use for multisets is in factorizations of natural
    numbers. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Notation for multisets is nonstandard—here are some common in
    use. ⦉

  ‖ If $a$ and $b$ are two distinct objects and $A = \set{a,
    b}$ is the unordered pair containing them, the multiset $m:
    A → 𝗡$ defined by $m(a) = 2$ and $m(b) = 3$ is sometimes
    denoted
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ ｛｛a,a,b,b,b｝｝ ⦉
    ⦉
    or alternatively
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ [a,a,b,b,b] ⦉
    ⦉
    or
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \set{a^2, b^3} ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ As it appears to the present authors, none of these is
    desirable. ⦉

  ‖ This last notation seems to be a reference to the notation
    for natural powers (a sheet not required by this one) and
    the use of multisets in number factorizations . ⦉
⦉

§§ Other terminology ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Other authors refer to the ordered pair $(A, m)$ as the
    multi set, and call $A$ the ❬underlying set❭. ⦉

  ‖ We avoid this terminology, for the reason that $\dom m =
    A$. ⦉
