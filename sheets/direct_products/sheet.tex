\ssection{Why}

We generalize the notion of a cross product of two sets to a cross produce of $n$ sets.

\ssection{Direct Products}

The \ct{direct product}{directproduct} of a natural family is the set of ordered sequences of elements from each set in the family.
% TODO: need to say what this is in terms of sets.
We call the elements of the direct product \ct{$n$-tuples}{ntuples}.
We call the $i$th element in an $n$-tuple the $i$th coordinate.
This language is meant to follow that used in defining ordered pairs.
%If the index set is the natural numbers, and every set in the family
%is the same set $A$, we call the elements of the direct product the
%\ct{sequences}{sequences} in $A$.
Two coordinates in a sequence are \t{consecutive} if their natural difference is 1.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $A_1, \dots, A_n$ be a natural family
of sets. We denote its direct product by
\[
  \product_{i = 1}^{n} A_{i}.
\]
We read this notation as \say{product over alpha in I of A sub-alpha.}
We denote an element of $\product_{i = 1}^{n} A_{i}$ by $(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n)$ with the understanding that $a_1 \in A_1, a_2 \in A_2, \dots, a_n \in A_n$.

If $A_i = A$ for $i = 1, \dots, n$, then we denote
$\product_{i = 1}^{n} A_{i}$ by $A^n$.
