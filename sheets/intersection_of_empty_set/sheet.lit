§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We only define set intersections for nonempty sets of sets. ⦉

  ‖ Why? ⦉
⦉

§ Discussion ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Which objects are specified by the sentence $(∀ x ∈ ∅)(x ∈
    X)$? ⦉

  ‖ Well, since no objects fail to satisfy the statement,
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will offer an account of this. ⦉
    ⦉
    the sentence specifies all objects. ⦉

  ‖ So in other words, the condition we used to define set
    intersections (
    <a href='/sheets/set_intersections.html'>
      ‖ Set Intersections ⦉
    </a>
    ) specifies the “set of everything}. ⦉

  ‖ In order to maintain other more desirable set principles
    like selection, we have said that such a set does not exist
    (see␣
    <a href='/sheets/set_specification.html'>
      ‖ Set Specification ⦉
    </a>
    ). ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ If, however, all sets under consideration are subsets of one
    paticular set—denote it $E$—then we can define intersections
    as follows. ⦉

  ‖ Let $𝒞$ be a possibly nonempty collection of sets
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \bigcap 𝒞 = \Set{X ∈ E}{(∀ X ∈ 𝒞)(x ∈ X)}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ This definition agrees with that given in␣
    <a href='/sheets/set_intersections.html'>
      ‖ Set Intersections ⦉
    </a>
    . ⦉

  ‖ In particular, it is the intersection of the set $𝒞 ∪
    \set{E}$ ⦉
⦉

§ Another definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ This begs the following question. ⦉

  ‖ Why not define intersections by selecting from the union. ⦉

  ‖ Let $𝒜$ be a possibly nonempty set of sets. ⦉

  ‖ Then define:
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \bigcap 𝒜 = \Set{x ∈ \bigcup 𝒜}{(∀ A ∈ 𝒜)(x ∈ A)}. ⦉
    ⦉

    ‖ If $𝒜$ is empty, so is $\bigcup 𝒜$ and then there are
      no elements in the set to select from so $\bigcap 𝒜$ is
      empty. ⦉

    ‖ This does not agree with the previous definitions for the
      empty set, but does for all other sets of sets. ⦉⦉
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ For these reasons, the intersection of the empty set is
      delicate.
      † ⦊
        ‖ Future editions will expand on the preference for the
          former definition. ⦉
