\section*{Why}

We are constantly thinking of $\R ^3$ as points of space.

\section*{Definition}

We commonly associate elements of $\R ^3$ with points in space. (see \sheetref{geometry}{Geometry}
).
\begin{principle}[Plane Sets]
There exists a set of all planes.\end{principle}
\begin{principle}[Real Space Correspondence]
Let $P$ be the set of all planes of space.
Then $\cup P$ is the set of all lines and $\cup \cup P$ is the set of all points.
There exists a one-to-one correspondence mapping elements of $\cup \cup P$ onto elements of $\R ^3$.\end{principle}
For this reason, we sometimes call elements of $\R ^3$ \t{points}.
We call the point associated with $(0, 0, 0)$ the \t{origin}.
We call the element of $\R ^3$ which corresponds to a point the \t{coordinates} of the point.

\section*{Visualization}

To visualize the correspondence we draw three perpendicular lines.
We call these \t{axes}.
We then associate a point of the line with $(0, 0, 0) \in \R ^3$.
We can label it so.
We then pick a unit length.
And proceed as usual.
