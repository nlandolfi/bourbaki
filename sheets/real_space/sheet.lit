§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We are constantly thinking of $𝗥^3$ as points of space.

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We commonly associate elements of $𝗥^3$ with points in
    space. (see
    <a href='/sheets/geometry.html'>
      ‖ Geometry ⦉
    </a>
    ). ⦉
  <statement type='principle' text='Plane Sets'>
    ‖ There exists a set of all planes. ⦉
  </statement>
  <statement type='principle' text='Real Space Correspondence'>
    ‖ Let $P$ be the set of all planes of space. ⦉

    ‖ Then $∪ P$ is the set of all lines and $∪ ∪ P$ is the
      set of all points. ⦉

    ‖ There exists a one-to-one correspondence mapping elements of
      $∪ ∪ P$ onto elements of $𝗥^3$. ⦉
  </statement>

  ‖ For this reason, we sometimes call elements of $𝗥^3$
    ❬points❭. ⦉

  ‖ We call the point associated with $(0, 0, 0)$ the ❬origin❭. ⦉

  ‖ We call the element of $𝗥^3$ which corresponds to a point
    the ❬coordinates❭ of the point. ⦉
⦉

§ Visualization ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ To visualize the correspondence we draw three perpendicular
    lines. ⦉

  ‖ We call these ❬axes❭. ⦉

  ‖ We then associate a point of the line with $(0, 0, 0) ∈
    𝗥^3$. ⦉

  ‖ We can label it so. ⦉

  ‖ We then pick a unit length. ⦉

  ‖ And proceed as usual.
