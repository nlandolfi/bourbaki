\section*{Why}

Trees have the fewest edges of any connected graph.
Among spanning trees of a weighted graph, can we find the one for which the sum of weights on the edges is minimal.

\section*{Why}

A \t{minimal spanning tree} is a spanning tree whose weight is minimal among all spanning trees.
A \t{maximal spanning tree} is a spanning tree whose weight is maximal among all spanning trees.
