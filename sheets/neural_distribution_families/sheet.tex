\section*{Why}

If neural networks are flexible function approximators, and we want flexible parameterizations of conditional distributions, we might use a neural network for the parameterizers.\footnote{Future editions will expand and modify.}

\section*{Definition}

A \t{neural conditional distribution family} (or \t{deep conditional distribution family}) is a parameterized conditional distribution family whose parameterizer is a neural network (see \sheetref{parameterized_distributions}{Parameterized Distributions}and \sheetref{neural_networks}{Neural Networks}).
When clear from context, we shorten to \t{neural conditional family} (or \t{deep conditional family}).

We similarly define a \t{neural latent generation family} (or \t{deep latent generation family}) and more generally for \t{neural distribution graphs} (or \t{deep distribution graphs}).
Other terminology for deep latent generation family includes \t{deep latent variable model} (\t{DLVM}).
