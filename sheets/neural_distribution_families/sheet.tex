\ssection{Definition}

A \t{neural conditional distribution family} (or \t{deep conditional distribution family}) is a parameterized conditional distribution family whose parameterizer is a neural network.

We similarly define a \t{neural latent generation family} (or \t{deep latent generation family}) and more generally for \t{neural distribution graphs} (or \t{deep distribution graphs}).
