§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ How does convergence pointwise (or almost everywhere
    pointwise) relate to convergence in measure? ⦉
⦉

§ Results ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ There exists ⦉

  ‖ a measure space ⦉

  ‖ and a sequence of ⦉

  ‖ measurable ⦉

  ‖ real-valued functions ⦉

  ‖ on that space ⦉

  ‖ converging everywhere ⦉

  ‖ (and so almost everywhere) ⦉

  ‖ but not converging ⦉

  ‖ in measure. ⦉

<proof>
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ be a measure space. ⦉

    ‖ Let $\seq{f}$ be a sequence of measurable functions on $X$
      such that $\seqt{f} \goesto f$ almost everywhere. ⦉

    ‖ Let $ϵ > 0$. ⦉
  ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ For each $x ∈ X$, if $\abs{f_n(x) - f(x)} > ϵ$ for
      infinitely many $n$, then $f_n(x) \not\goesto f(x)$. ⦉

    ‖ Let $A$ be the set of such $x$ and let $B = \Set*{ x
      ∈ X }{ f_n(x) \not\goesto f(x) }$. ⦉

    ‖ $A$ is a subset of $B$. ⦉

    ‖ The measure of $B$ is zero since $f_n \goesto f$. ⦉

    ‖ Use the the monotonicity of measure to conclude. ⦉

    ‖ $μ(A) ≤ μ(B) = 0$. ⦉

    ‖ Since $μ(A) ≥ 0$, ⦉

    ‖ $μ(A) = 0$. ⦉
  ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ For natural $k$, let $E_k$ be the $\Set*{x ∈ X}
      {\abs{f_k(x) - f(x)} > ϵ}$. ⦉

    ‖ Then $x ∈ A$ means that for every natural $n$, there
      exists a $k ≥ n$ such that $x ∈ E_k$. ⦉

    ‖ In particular, for every $n$, $x$ is in $∪_{k =
      n}^{∞}E_k$; ⦉

    ‖ denote this set by $B_n$. ⦉

    ‖ If $x$ is in $B_n$ for every ⦉

    ‖ $n$, then ⦉

    ‖ $x ∈ ∩_{n = 1}^{∞} B_n$. ⦉

    ‖ So we can write
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ A = ⋂_{n = 1}^{∈fty} ⦉

        ‖ ⋃_{k = n}^{∈fty} ⦉

        ‖ E_k ⦉

        ‖ = ⋂_{n = 1}^{∈fty} ⦉

        ‖ B_n ⦉

        ‖ . ⦉
      ⦉⦉

    ‖ The sequence of sets $\seq{B}$ is decreasing. So since $μ$
      is finite,
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ \lim_{n → ∈fty} μ(B_n) = μ(A) = 0. ⦉
      ⦉⦉

    ‖ For every $n$, the set $B_n$ contains $\Set*{x ∈
      X}{\abs{f_n(x) - f(x)} > ϵ}$, namely $E_n$, the first set
      in the union. ⦉

    ‖ So then $μ(E_n) ≤ μ(B_n)$ by monotonicity and so
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ 0 ⦉

        ‖ ≤ \lim_{n → ∈fty} μ(E_n) ⦉

        ‖ ≤ \lim_{n → ∈fty} μ(B_n) ⦉

        ‖ = 0, ⦉
      ⦉⦉

    ‖ and we conclude $\lim_{n} E_n = 0$. ⦉

    ‖ Since $ϵ$ was arbitrary, ⦉

    ‖ we conclude $f_n \goesto f$ in ⦉

    ‖ measure. ⦉
