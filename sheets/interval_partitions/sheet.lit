§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We partition a real interval into interval pieces. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ An ❬interval partition❭ is a finite partition of a closed
    real interval. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ An interval partition is ❬regular❭ if all pieces except the
    largest are closed on the left and open on the right and
    the largest is closed. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Any regular interval partition with $n-1$ elements can be
    represented by $n+1$ real numbers: the endpoints of each
    interval. ⦉

  ‖ We call these the ❬cut points❭ of the interval partition. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $[a, b]$ a closed interval in $𝗥$ with endpoints $a, b
    ∈ 𝗥$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Consider a regular partition of $[a,b]$ with $n-1$ pieces. ⦉

  ‖ We can identify its cut points:
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ a = a_1 < a_2 < … a_{n-1} < a_n = b. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ The pieces of the partition are:
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ [a_1, a_2), ⦉

      ‖ [a_2, a_3), ⦉

      ‖ …, ⦉

      ‖ [a_{n-2}, a_{n-1}), ⦉

      ‖ [a_{n-1}, a_n]. ⦉
