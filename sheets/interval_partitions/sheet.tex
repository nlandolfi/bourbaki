\section*{Why}

We partition a real interval into interval pieces.

\section*{Definition}

An \t{interval partition} is a finite partition of a closed real interval.

An interval partition is \t{regular} if all pieces except the largest are closed on the left and open on the right and the largest is closed.

Any regular interval partition with $n-1$ elements can be represented by $n+1$ real numbers: the endpoints of each interval.
We call these the \t{cut points} of the interval partition.

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $[a, b]$ a closed interval in $\R $ with endpoints $a, b \in \R $.

Consider a regular partition of $[a,b]$ with $n-1$ pieces.
We can identify its cut points:
\[
a = a_1 < a_2 < \dots  a_{n-1} < a_n = b.
\]
The pieces of the partition are:
\[
[a_1, a_2),
[a_2, a_3),
\dots ,
[a_{n-2}, a_{n-1}),
[a_{n-1}, a_n].
\]
