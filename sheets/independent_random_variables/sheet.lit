¶ ⦊
  ‖ What does it mean for two random variables to be
    independent? ⦉

⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Two random variables are ❬independent❭ if the sigma algebras
    generated by the random variables are independent. ⦉

  ‖ In general, a family of random variables are ❬independent❭
    if the sigma algebras generated by the random variables are
    independent. ⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ be a probability space and $(Y, \SB)$ be
    a measurable space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $f_1,f_2: X → Y$ be random variables. ⦉

  ‖ If the random variables are independent we write $f_1 ⟂
    f_2$. ⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ \begin{prop} ⦉

  ‖ Let $f_1, …, f_n$ be independent real-valued random variables
    defined on a probability space $(X, 𝒜, μ)$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $B_1, …, B_n$ be Borel sets of real numbers and let
    $A_i = f_i^{-1}(B_i)$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $A = ∩_{i = 1}^{n} f_i^{-1}(B_i)$. ⦉

  ‖ Then

      ‖ μ(A) = ∏_{i = 1}^{n} μ(A_i) ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ \begin{proof} ⦉

  ‖ Since $f_i$ are independent, so are the sigma algebras they
    generate. ⦉

  ‖ $A_i$ are in each of these sigma algebras, so by definition
    of independence the measure of the intersection is the
    product of the measures. ⦉
