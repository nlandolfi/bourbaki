§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ What does it mean for two random variables to be
    independent? ⦉

  ‖ What are the events associated with a random variable? ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Two random variables are ❬independent❭ if the sigma algebras
    generated by the random variables are independent. ⦉

  ‖ In general, a family of random variables are ❬independent❭
    if the sigma algebras generated by the random variables are
    independent. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜 , μ )$ be a probability space and $(Y, ℬ)$ be
    a measurable space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $f_1,f_2: X → Y$ be random variables. ⦉

  ‖ If the random variables are independent we write $f_1 ⊥
    f_2$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Results ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Let $f_1, … , f_n$ be independent real-valued random
    variables defined on a probability space $(X, 𝒜 , μ )$. ⦉
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Let $B_1, … , B_n$ be Borel sets of real numbers and
      let $A_i = f_i^{-1}(B_i)$. ⦉

    ‖ Let $A = \cap_{i = 1}^{n} f_i^{-1}(B_i)$. ⦉

    ‖ Then
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ μ (A) = ∏_{i = 1}^{n} μ (A_i) ⦉

  ⦉

  <proof>
    ‖ Since $f_i$ are independent, so are the sigma algebras
      they generate. ⦉

    ‖ $A_i$ are in each of these sigma algebras, so by
      definition of independence the measure of the intersection
      is the product of the measures. ⦉
