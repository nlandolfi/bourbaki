§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ An ❬affine combination❭ from $𝗥^n$ is a linear combination
    whose scalars sum to 1. ⦉

  ‖ As with linear combinations, we say that $y$ is an ❬can be
    written as an affine combination of❭ of the vectors $x_1, …,
    x_k ∈ 𝗥^n$ if there exists $λ_1, …, λ_k ∈ 𝗥$ so that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ y = ∑_{i =1 }^{k} λ_i x_i ⦉
    ⦉
    and $∑_{i = 1}^{k} λ_i = 1$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ All affine combinations of two distint vectors $x, y ∈ 𝗥^n$
    is the line through $x$ and $y$, which we denote as usual
    $L(x, y)$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ L(x, y) = \Set{(1-λ)x + λy}{λ ∈ 𝗥} ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A set of vectors $\set{v_1, …, v_k}$ is ❬affinely dependent❭
    if one can be written as an affine combination of the
    others. ⦉

  ‖ A set of vectors which is not affinely dependent is called
    an ❬affinely independent set of vectors❭. ⦉

  ‖ An equivalent condition is that there exist an affine
    combination in these vectors in which at least one scalar is
    nonzero and the sum of all the scalars is 1. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Suppose $y ∈ 𝗥^n$. ⦉

  ‖ The set $X = \set{x_1, …, x_k} ⊂ 𝗥^n$ is affinely
    dependent if and only if $y + X$ is. ⦉
