\section*{Why}

Suppose a measure is not interchangeable with another.
Then what.
We can separate out the troublesome piece; perhaps it can be handled separately.

\section*{Result}

\begin{proposition}
Let $(X, \mathcal{A} )$ be a measurable space.
Let $\mu $ be a measure on $(X, \mathcal{A} )$.
Let $\nu $ be a finite signed measure or complex measure or $\sigma $-finite measure on $(X, \mathcal{A} )$.
There there is a unique decomposition $\nu  = \nu _a + \nu _s$ where $\nu _a \ll \mu $ and $\nu _s \perp \mu $.

\end{proposition}

The above is also called \t{Lebesgue's Decomposition Theorem}
