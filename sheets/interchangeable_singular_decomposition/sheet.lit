§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose a measure is not interchangeable with another. ⦉

  ‖ Then what. ⦉

  ‖ We can separate out the troublesome piece; perhaps it can
    be handled separately. ⦉
⦉

§ Result ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜)$ be a measurable space. ⦉

    ‖ Let $μ$ be a measure on $(X, 𝒜)$. ⦉

    ‖ Let $ν$ be a finite signed measure or complex measure or
      $σ$-finite measure on $(X, 𝒜)$. ⦉

    ‖ There there is a unique decomposition $ν = ν_a + ν_s$
      where $ν_a ≪ μ$ and $ν_s ⊥μ$. ⦉
