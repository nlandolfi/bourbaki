%!name:introduction

The Bourbaki Project is a collection of documents describing mathematical concepts, terms, results and notation.
Each is named and labeled with perquisites.
% The prerequisites are the names of those documents which should be first read by the unaquainted reader.


\ssection{Sheets}
We call these documents \t{sheets}.
They are only ever two-pages long and sometimes shorter.
They can be printed on a single sheet of paper, hence the name sheet.
In a book, they occupy two facing pages.
The decision to cap at two pages is arbitrary.
But our experience suggests it is convenient.


\ssection{Prerequisites}

Each sheet is labeled with its immediate prerequisites, those sheets for which it is an immediate prerequisite, and a diagram illustrating the dependencies for all sheets it may reference.

We call all prerequisite sheets that should be read before a particular sheet $X$ the \t{needs} of $X$.
For example, the sheet \sheetref{relations}{Relations} needs the sheet \sheetref{ordered_pairs}{Ordered Pairs}.
The reason, in this case, is that the concept of a relation is discussed using the concept of an ordered pair of objects.
And since the phrase \say{ordered pair of objects} makes sense only if we know what is meant by object (discussed in the sheet \sheetref{objects}{Objects}), the sheet \sheetref{relations}{Relations} needs the sheet \sheetref{objects}{Objects} also.
The reader unacquainted with ordered pairs and objects must read (at least) these two sheets before the sheet on relations.
% So needs order the sheets to be read.

The prequisites of a sheet are naturally ordered.
Suppose $X$ needs both $Y$ and $Z$, and $Y$ in turn needs $Z$.
In this case, $Z$ ought to be read first, $Y$ second, and $X$ last.
We ensure that such an ordering always exists by enforcing the following constraint: if a sheet $X$ needs a sheet $Y$, then $Y$ can not need $X$ or any sheet that needs $X$.
For convenience, we list for each sheet only those prerequisite sheets which are not a prerequisite to another prerequisite.
So if \sheetref{ordered_pairs}{Ordered Pairs} needed \sheetref{objects}{Objects}, then even thought \sheetref{relations}{Relations} needs both \sheetref{ordered_pairs}{Ordered Pairs} and \sheetref{objects}{Objects}, we would only list \sheetref{ordered_pairs}{Ordered Pairs}.
% a page are minimal. That is to say,
% for sheet $X$ we only list the sheets
% which are in the needs of $X$
% and not needed by any other sheet
% in the needs of $X$.
% If $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ are as before,
% then we only list $Y$ as $X$'s needs
% because $Z$ is implicit (through $Y$).
% The sheets and their needs are probably
% best explored by browsing the project;
% the index is
% a reasonable starting point.

\ssection{Aims}
Our primary aim is two-fold.
First, to provide useful exposition to teach the concepts to an unaquainted reader.
And second, to serve as a reference for further work.
It is a welcomed concomitant that we better understand and develop the mathematical concepts ourselves.

\ssection{Caveats.}
There are two caveats.
First, Bourbaki gives
only one path to concepts.
Bourbaki is like a map:
the landmarks are concepts.
Walking is reading.
And you must walk along the
trails specified by the needs.
The point is that the Bourbaki way
of structuring the concepts is just
one way, and there are many ways, since
there are equivalent concepts,
alternate proofs, and so on.
The second caveat is a wink:
these sheets are fiction.
They contain only ideas.
We have done our
best to eliminate all false statements.
But very little is said about
fitting these puzzle pieces to
reality.
