\ssection{Why}\footnote{Future editions will include. It is a simplifiying assumption.}

\ssection{Definition}

Two random variables are \t{independent and identically distributed} if they are independent and have the same law.
A sequence of random variables is \t{independent and identically distributed} if the random variables are independent and each random variable has the same law.

\ssubsection{Notation}

We abbreviate independent and identically distributed by \t{i.i.d.} or \t{iid} or \t{IID}.
Each of these is read aloud as \say{i i d}.
