\ssection{Why}

We provide a principle for density
selection based on maximizing the
probability of the dataset.

\ssection{Definition}

Let $(x^1, \dots, x^n)$ be a dataset
in $\R^d$.

The \ct{principle of maximum likelihood}{}
says to solve:
\[
  \maximization{f \text{ a density}}{\product_{k = 1}^{n} f(x^k)}
\]
We call a solution of the
above problem a
\ct{maximum likelihood density}{}.
We call the objective of the
above problem
\ct{density likelihood}{}.
