§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to talk about sequences in a metric space which
    are “bunching up,” and whether and when this means they
    converge. ⦉

  ‖ We generalize the notion of real egoprox sequences. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A sequence in a metric space is ❬egoprox❭ (or ❬Cauchy❭) if
    for every positive real number, there exists a final part of
    the sequence so that any two terms are less than the
    positive number apart.
    † ⦊
      ‖ The term Cauchy is universal, but in accordance with the
        Bourbaki project’s guidelines on naming, we will tend to
        use the term egoprox. ⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $(X, d)$ is a metric space and $\seq{x}$ is a
    sequence in $X$. ⦉

  ‖ $\seq{x}$ is egoprox means for every $ϵ > 0$, there exists
    $N ∈ 𝗡$ so that, for all $m, n ≥ N$
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ d(x_n, x_m) < ϵ ⦉
