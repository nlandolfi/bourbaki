§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We talk about sequences in a metric space which are
    “bunching up.” ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A sequence in a metric space is ❬egoprox❭ (or ❬Cauchy❭) if
    for every positive real number, there exists a final part of
    the sequence so that any two terms are less than the
    positive number apart.
    † ⦊
      ‖ The term Cauchy is universal, but in accordance with the
        Bourbaki project’s guidelines on naming, we will tend to
        use the term egoprox. ⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space. ⦉

  ‖ Then $(x_n)_{n ∈ 𝗡}$ a sequence in $X$ is egoprox if, for
    every $ϵ > 0$, there exists $N ∈ 𝗡$ so that, for all $m,
    n ≥ N$
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ d(x_n, x_m) < ϵ. ⦉
