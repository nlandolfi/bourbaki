\section*{Why}

The number of vectors in any basis is the same.

\section*{Defining result}

A vector space is \t{finite-dimensional} if it has a finite basis; otherwise it is it is \t{infinite-dimensional}.

\begin{proposition}
Every basis of a finitely spanned vector space has the same number of elements.\end{proposition}
The \t{dimension} of a finite-dimensional vector space is the number of distinct vectors in any basis.
If a vector space is finite-dimensional and every basis has $n$ distinct elements we call it a \t{$n$-dimensional vector space}.
