\ssection{Why}

We want a simple example of
modeling an uncertain outcome.

\ssection{Model}

Consider flipping a coin.
The coin has two sides.
When we flip the coin,
it lands heads or tails.

Let us use the set of outcomes $\set{0, 1}$.
If the coin lands tails, we will
say that outcome 0 has occurred.
If the coin lands heads, we will
say that outcome 1 has occurred.
