\ssection{Why}

We want a simple example of
modeling an uncertain outcome.
We consider flipping a coin.

\ssection{Model}

The die has six sides.
When we flip the coin,
it lands heads or tails.
Let us model this uncertain
outcome with the set of outcomes
$\set{0, 1}$.

If the coin lands tails, we will
say that outcome 0 has occurred.
If the coin lands heads, we will
say that outcome 1 has occurred.
