\ssection{Why}

We want to talk about things.

\ssection{Definition}

We use the word \ct{object}{object}
with its usual sense in the English
language.
An object may be tangible, in that
we can hold or touch it,
or an object may be abstract,
in that we can do neither.

\ssubsection{Notation}

To aid in discussing and
denoting objects, let
us tend to give them
short names.
A single Latin
letter regularly suffices:
for example,
$a$, $b$ or $c$.
To aid our memory,
we tend to choose the
letter mnemonically.
