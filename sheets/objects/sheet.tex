\ssection{Why}

We want to talk about things.

\ssection{Definition}

We use the word \t{object} with its usual sense in the English language.
An object may be tangible, in that we can hold or touch it, or an object may be abstract, in that we can do neither.

To discuss objects we give them \t{names}.
When discussing abstract objects, we tend to give them short names.
A single Latin letter regularly suffices.
We use italics when writing the name.
For example, we will refer to the object named \say{a} by $a$.
To aid our memory, we tend to choose the letter mnemonically.
