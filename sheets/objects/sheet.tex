\section*{Why}

We want to talk and write about things.

\section*{Definition}

We use the word \t{object} with its usual sense in the English language.
Objects that we can touch we call \t{tangible}.
Otherwise, we say that the object is \t{intangible}.

\subsection*{Examples}

We pick up a pebble for an example of a tangible object.
The pebble is an object.
We can hold and touch it.
And because we can touch it, the pebble is tangible.

We consider the color of the pebble as an example of an intangible object.
The color is an object also, even though we can not hold it or touch it.
Because we can not touch it, the color is intangible.
These sheets discuss other intangible objects and little else besides.
