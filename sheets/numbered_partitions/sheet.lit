§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given a set $S$, a ❬numbered partition❭ of $S$ (or ❬labeled
    partition❭) is a numbering of some partition of a $S$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, a numbered partition $(π_1, …, π_p)$ of $S$
    is such that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \set{π_1, …, π_p} \quad \text{ partitions } \quad S ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ As before, $π_i$ is called a ❬part❭ of the partition, for
    $i = 1, …, n$. ⦉

  ‖ In this case $p$ is the ❬size❭ and $(\num{π_1}, …,
    \num{π_p})$ is the ❬shape❭ of the numbered partition. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ When we speak simultaneously of partitions (as defined in␣
    <a href='/sheets/partitions.html'>
      ‖ Partitions ⦉
    </a>
    ) and numbered partitions, we sometimes call a ‹partition›
    an ❬unnumbered partition❭ (or ❬unlabeled partition❭,
    ❬allocation❭). ⦉

  ‖ In this case, the ❬size❭ of a partition $P$ of $S$ is the
    multiset $m: 𝗡 → 𝗡$ defined so that $m(k)$ is the number
    of parts of size $k$ in $P$. ⦉
