Given a set $S$, a \t{numbered partition} of $S$ (or \t{labeled partition}) is a numbering of some partition of a $S$.
In other words, a numbered partition $(\pi _1, \dots , \pi _p)$ of $S$ is such that
\[
\set{\pi _1, \dots , \pi _p} \quad \text{ partitions } \quad S
\]
As before, $\pi _i$ is called a \t{part} of the partition, for $i = 1, \dots , n$.
In this case $p$ is the \t{size} and $(\num{\pi _1}, \dots , \num{\pi _p})$ is the \t{shape} of the numbered partition.

When we speak simultaneously of partitions (as defined in \sheetref{partitions}{Partitions}) and numbered partitions, we sometimes call a \textit{partition} an \t{unnumbered partition} (or \t{unlabeled partition}, \t{allocation}).
In this case, the \t{size} of a partition $P$ of $S$ is the multiset $m: \N   \to \N  $ defined so that $m(k)$ is the number of parts of size $k$ in $P$.
