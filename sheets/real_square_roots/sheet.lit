§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to solve equations with squares. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $b$ be any real number. ⦉

  ‖ We want to find $a$ to solve
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ a^2 = b. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ We call a solution $a$ a ❬square root❭ of $b$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ \begin{proposition} ⦉

  ‖ A positive real number has two square roots.
    † ⦊

    ⦉⦉

  ‖ \end{proposition} ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Despite the above proposition, we still speak of ❬the square
    root❭ of a real number, which is the positive square root. ⦉

  ‖ We also speak of the ❬square root function❭ which associates
    a real number to its positive square root. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ \begin{proposition} ⦉

  ‖ A two roots or a positive real number are additive
    inverses.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will include an account. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ \end{proposition} ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ As with natural numbers, we denote ‹the› (positive) square
    root of the real number $x ∈ 𝗥$ by $√{x}$. ⦉

  ‖ Some authors refer to both the roots of $x$ by writing
    $±√{x}$. ⦉
