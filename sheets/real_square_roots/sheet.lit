§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to solve equations with squares. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given a real number $a$, we call any number $r ∈ 𝗥$
    satisfying
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ r^2 = a ⦉
    ⦉
    a ❬square root❭ of $a$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We can show that any positive real number has ‹two› square
    roots. ⦉
  <statement type='proposition'>
    ‖ Suppose $a ∈ 𝗥$ and $a > 0$. ⦉

    ‖ Then the set
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ \Set{r ∈ 𝗥}{r^2 = a} ⦉
      ⦉
      has size 2. ⦉
  </statement>
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Furthermore, these two roots are each the additive inverse
    of each other.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will include the account. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
  <statement type='proposition'>
    ‖ Suppose $a ∈ 𝗥$ and $a > 0$. ⦉

    ‖ If $r_1, r_2 ∈ 𝗥$, $r_1 ≠ r_2$ are the two distinct
      square roots of $a$, then $r_1 = -r_2$. ⦉
  </statement>
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ When speaking of ‹the› square root of a real number, we
    mean to reference the ‹positive› square root. ⦉

  ‖ We also speak of the ❬square root function❭ which associates
    a real number to its positive square root. ⦉
⦉


§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ As with natural numbers, we denote ‹the› (positive) square
    root of the real number $x ∈ 𝗥$ by $√{x}$. ⦉

  ‖ Some authors refer to both the roots of $x$ by writing
    $±√{x}$. ⦉
