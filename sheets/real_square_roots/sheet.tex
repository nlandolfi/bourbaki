\ssection{Why}

We want to solve equations
with squares.

Let $b$ be any real
number.
We want to find $a$
to solve
\[
  a^2 = b.
\]
We call $a$

\begin{prop}
A real number has two square
roots.
\end{prop}

Despite the following proposition,
we still speak of the
\ct{square root function}{}
which associates a real number to
its positive square root.

\ssection{Why}

As with natural numbers, we denote
the square root of $x$ by $\sqrt{x}$.
