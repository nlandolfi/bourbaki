\ssection{Why}

We want to solve equations with squares.

\ssection{Definition}

Let $b$ be any real number.
We want to find $a$ to solve
$$
  a^2 = b.
$$
We call a solution $a$ a \t{square root} of $b$.

\begin{prop}
A real number has two square roots.
\end{prop}

Despite the above proposition, we still speak of \t{the square root} of a real number, which is the positive square root.
We also speak of the \t{square root function} which associates a real number to its positive square root.

\ssection{Why}

As with natural numbers, we denote the square root of $x$ by $\sqrt{x}$.
