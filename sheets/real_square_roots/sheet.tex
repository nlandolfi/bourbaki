\ssection{Why}

We want to solve equations with squares.

\ssection{Definition}

Let $b$ be any real number.
We want to find $a$ to solve
$$
  a^2 = b.
$$
We call a solution $a$ a \t{square root} of $b$.

\begin{prop}
  A positive real number has two square roots.\footnote{Future editions will include an account.}
\end{prop}

Despite the above proposition, we still speak of \t{the square root} of a real number, which is the positive square root.
We also speak of the \t{square root function} which associates a real number to its positive square root.

\begin{prop}
  A two roots or a positive real number are additive inverses.\footnote{Future editions will include an account.}
\end{prop}

\ssubsection{Notation}

As with natural numbers, we denote \textit{the} (positive) square root of the real number $x \in \R$ by $\sqrt{x}$.
Some authors refer to both the roots of $x$ by writing $\pm\sqrt{x}$.
