\ssection{Why}

We define integrals using an infinite process; in order for each step of the process to make sense, we need functions to be measurable.\footnote{This statement contains a forward reference to \sheetref{real_integrals}{Real Integrals}, and so may be modified in future editions.}

\ssection{Definition}

A function between the base sets of two measurable spaces is
\t{measurable}
with respect to the distinguished
sets of the two spaces if the
inverse image of every
distinguished subset of the
codomain is a distinguished
subset of the domain.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(X, \mathcal{A})$
and $(Y, \mathcal{B})$
be measurable spaces.
Then a function
$f: X \to Y$ is measurable
if $B \in \mathcal{B}$
implies $f^{-1}(B) \in \mathcal{A}$.
We say that $f$ is measurable
with respect to $\mathcal{A}$ and
$\mathcal{B}$.

In this case, we sometimes say
$f$ is a measurable function
from $(X, \mathcal{A})$ to
$(Y, \mathcal{B})$.
We say,
$f: (X, \mathcal{A}) \to (Y, \mathcal{B})$
is measurable, read aloud as
\say{f from X, A to
  Y, B is measurable.}
