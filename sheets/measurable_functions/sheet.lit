§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We define integrals using an infinite process; in order for
    each step of the process to make sense, we need functions
    to be measurable.

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A function between the base sets of two measurable spaces is ⦉

  ‖ ❬measurable❭ ⦉

  ‖ with respect to the distinguished ⦉

  ‖ sets of the two spaces if the ⦉

  ‖ inverse image of every ⦉

  ‖ distinguished subset of the ⦉

  ‖ codomain is a distinguished ⦉

  ‖ subset of the domain. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜)$ ⦉

  ‖ and $(Y, ℬ)$ ⦉

  ‖ be measurable spaces. ⦉

  ‖ Then a function ⦉

  ‖ $f: X → Y$ is measurable ⦉

  ‖ if $B ∈ ℬ$ ⦉

  ‖ implies $f^{-1}(B) ∈ 𝒜$. ⦉

  ‖ We say that $f$ is measurable ⦉

  ‖ with respect to $𝒜$ and ⦉

  ‖ $ℬ$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ In this case, we sometimes say ⦉

  ‖ $f$ is a measurable function ⦉

  ‖ from $(X, 𝒜)$ to ⦉

  ‖ $(Y, ℬ)$. ⦉

  ‖ We say, ⦉

  ‖ $f: (X, 𝒜) → (Y, ℬ)$ ⦉

  ‖ is measurable, read aloud as ⦉

  ‖ “f from X, A to ⦉

  ‖ Y, B is measurable.” ⦉
