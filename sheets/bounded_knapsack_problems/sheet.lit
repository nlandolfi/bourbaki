§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We consider the knapsack problem in which the $n$ items are
    considered to be types of items and we have a certain
    quantity of each. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose we have zero-one knapsack problem data $(p, w, c)$
    where $p: [n] → 𝗥$ is the profit function, $w: [n] → 𝗥_+$
    is the weight function, and $c ∈ 𝗥_+$ is the capacity
    constraint. ⦉

  ‖ The above is called the ❬bounded knapsack problem❭. ⦉

  ‖ The problem above ‹without› the budget constraints, is called
    the ❬unbounded knapsack problem❭. ⦉
