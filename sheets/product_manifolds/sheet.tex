\section*{Why}

If we have two manifolds, is there product a manifold?

\section*{Result}

The answer is yes.

\begin{proposition}
Let $X$ and $Y$ be manifolds. Then $X \times Y$ is a manifold and $\dim X \times Y = \dim X + \dim Y$.\footnote{Future editions will include an account.}
\end{proposition}
