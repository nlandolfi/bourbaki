\section*{Why}

We want to talk about which sets of points correspond to cubes in space.

\section*{Definition}

A \t{cube} is a product of three intervals.
Some authors use the term \t{box} or re-use the term \t{rectangle}.
As with rectangles, we apply the adjectivies open, closed, left-open, left-closed accordingly.
