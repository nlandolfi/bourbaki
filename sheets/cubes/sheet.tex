\ssection{Why}

We want to talk about which sets of points correspond to cubes in space.

\ssection{Definition}

A \t{cube} is a product of of three intervals.\footnote{Some authors use the term box, or re-use the term rectangle.}
As with rectangles, we apply the adjectivies open, closed, left-open, left-closed accordingly.
