\ssection{Why}

A probability event function is a measure on the set of outcomes.

\ssection{Definition}

A \t{probability measure} is a finite measure on a measurable space which assigns the value one to the base set.
A finite measure can always be scaled to a probability measure, so these measures are standard examples of finite measures.

A \t{probability space} is a measure space whose measure is a probability measure.
The word \say{space} is natural, since the notion of a measure generalized the notion of volume in real space (see \sheetref{real_space}{Real Space} and \sheetref{n-dimensional_space}{N-Dimensional Space}).
The \t{outcomes} of a probability space are the elements of the base set.
The \t{set of outcomes} is the base set.
The \t{events} are the elements of the sigma algebra.
The measure in a probability space corresponds to the event probability function.


\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(A, \SA)$ be a measurable space.\footnote{Often, other authors will denote the set of outcomes (here denoted by $A$) by $\Omega$, a mnemonic for \say{outcomes.}}
We denote the sigma-algebra by $\SA$, as usual.
We denote a probability measure by $\PM$, a mnemonic for \say{probability,} and intended to remind of the event probabilty function.
Thus, we often say \say{Let $(A, \SA, \PM)$ be a probability space.}


Many authors associate an event $A \in \CA$ with a function $\pi: \CX \to \set{0, 1}$ so that $A = \Set*{x \in \CX}{\pi(x) = 1}$.
In this context, it is common to write $\mu[\pi(x)]$ for $\mu(A)$.
