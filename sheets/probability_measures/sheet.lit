§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A probability event function is a measure on the measurable
    space consisting of the set of outcomes and the set of
    events. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬probability measure❭ is a finite measure on a measurable
    space which assigns the value one to the base set. ⦉

  ‖ A finite measure can always be scaled to a probability
    measure, so these measures are standard examples of finite
    measures. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬probability space❭ is a measure space whose measure is a
    probability measure. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬outcomes❭ of a probability space are the elements of
    the base set. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬set of outcomes❭ is the base set. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬events❭ are the elements of the sigma algebra. ⦉

  ‖ The measure in a probability space corresponds to the event
    probability function. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜)$ be a measurable space.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Often, other authors will denote the set of outcomes
        (here denoted by $X$) by $Ω$, an apparent mnemonic for
        “outcomes”. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ We denote the sigma-algebra by $𝒜$, as usual. ⦉

  ‖ We denote a probability measure by $𝗣$, a mnemonic for
    “probability,” and intended to remind of the event probabilty
    function.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Often, other authors will use notation including $P$,
        $Pr$, $\text{Prob}$, and $\text{pr}$. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

‖ Thus, we often say “Let $(X, 𝒜, 𝗣)$ be a probability space.” ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Many authors associate an event $A ∈ 𝒜$ with a function
    $π: X → \set{0, 1}$ so that $A = \Set*{x ∈ X}{π(x) = 1}$. ⦉

  ‖ In this context, it is common to write $μ[π(x)]$ for $μ(A)$. ⦉
