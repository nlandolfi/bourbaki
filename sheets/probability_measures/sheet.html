    <h1>
Why    </h1>

    <p>
      <span class='run'>A probability event function is a measure
        on the set of outcomes.</span>
    </p>

    <h1>
Definition    </h1>

    <p>
      <span class='run'>A <span class='term'>probability measure</span>
        is a finite measure on a measurable space
        which assigns the value one to the base
        set.</span>

      <span class='run'>A finite measure can always be scaled to
        a probability measure, so these measures are
        standard examples of finite measures.</span>
    </p>


    <p>
      <span class='run'>A <span class='term'>probability space</span>
        is a measure space whose measure is a
        probability measure.</span>

      <span class='run'>The word “space} is natural, since the
        notion of a measure generalized the notion
        of volume in real space (see<a href='/sheets/real_space.html'/>        <span class='run'>Real Space</span></a>
        and<a href='/sheets/n-dimensional_space.html'/>        <span class='run'>N-Dimensional Space</span></a>
        ).</span>

      <span class='run'>The <span class='term'>outcomes</span> of a
        probability space are the elements of the
        base set.</span>

      <span class='run'>The <span class='term'>set of outcomes</span>
        is the base set.</span>

      <span class='run'>The <span class='term'>events</span> are the
        elements of the sigma algebra.</span>

      <span class='run'>The measure in a probability space
        corresponds to the event probability function.</span>
    </p>

    <h2>
Notation    </h2>

    <p>
      <span class='run'>Let $(A, \mathcal{A} )$ be a measurable
        space.<sup id='footnote-1-reference'><a href='#footnote-1'>1</a></sup></span>

      <span class='run'>We denote the sigma-algebra by
        $\mathcal{A} $, as usual.</span>

      <span class='run'>We denote a probability measure by
        $\mathbfsf{P} $, a mnemonic for “probability,”
        and intended to remind of the event
        probabilty function.</span>

      <span class='run'>Thus, we often say “Let $(A, \mathcal{A} ,
        \mathbfsf{P} )$ be a probability space.”</span>
    </p>


    <p>
      <span class='run'>Many authors associate an event $A \in
        \mathcal{A} $ with a function $\pi :
        \mathcal{X}  \to \set{0, 1}$ so that $A =
        \Set*{x \in \mathcal{X} }{\pi (x) = 1}$.</span>

      <span class='run'>In this context, it is common to write
        $\mu [\pi (x)]$ for $\mu (A)$.</span>
    </p>
<ol class='footnotes'><li id='footnote-1'>      <span class='run'>Often, other authors will denote the set
        of outcomes (here denoted by $A$) by
        $\Omega $, an apparent mnemonic for
        “outcomes”.</span><a href='#footnote-1-reference'>↩︎</a></li></ol>
