¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to order the real numbers.

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ For $R, S ∈ 𝗥$ define the total order $≻eq$ by $R ≻eq S$
    if and only if $R ⊂ S$. ⦉

  ‖ As is usual with comparisons, we use the terms ❬less than❭
    and ❬less than or equal to❭. ⦉

  <!--
% If $R \subset S$ and $R \neq S$ then we say that $R$ is \t{less than} $S$.
% If $R \subset S$ then we say that $R$ is \t{less than or equal to} $S$.
-->

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ If $R$ is less than $S$ we write $R < S$. ⦉

  ‖ If $R$ is less than or equal to $S$ we write $R ≤ S$. ⦉
