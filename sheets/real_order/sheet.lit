§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to order the real numbers.

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $R, S ⊂ 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ If $R ⊂ S$ and $R ≠ S$ then we say that $R$ is ❬less
    than❭ $S$ ⦉

  ‖ If $R ⊂ S$ then we say that $R$ is ❬less than or equal
    to❭ $S$. ⦉

  ‖ This can be shown to define a total order on $𝗥$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ If $R$ is less than $S$ we write $R < S$. ⦉

  ‖ If $R$ is less than or equal to $S$ we write $R ≤ S$. ⦉
