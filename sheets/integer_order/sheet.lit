§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to order the integers. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Consider $\eqc{(a, b)}, \eqc{(b, c)} ∈ 𝗭$. ⦉

  ‖ If $a + d < b + c$, then we say that ⦉

  ‖ $\eqc{(a, b)}$ is ❬less than❭ $\eqc{(b, c)}$.
    † ⦊
      ‖ One needs to show that this is well-defined. The account
        will appear in future editions. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ If $\eqc{(a, b)}$ is less than $\eqc{(b, c)}$ or equal,
    then we say that $\eqc{(a, b)}$ is ❬less than or equal to❭
    $\eqc{(b, c)}$. ⦉
⦉

§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ If $x, y ∈ 𝗭$ and $x$ is less than $y$, then we write
    $x < y$. ⦉

  ‖ If $x$ is less than or equal to $y$, we write $x ≤ y$. ⦉
⦉

§ Positive and negative integers ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We call an integer $z$ ❬positive❭ if $z > 0$ and we call
    $z$ ❬negative❭ if $z < 0$.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Some authors use the term positive for the case when $z
        > 0$ or $z = 0$. We use the term nonnegative in this
        case. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ We call an integer $z$ ❬nonnegative❭ if $z > 0$ or $z =
    0$ and ❬nonpositive❭ if $z < 0$ or $z = 0$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the set $\Set{z ∈ 𝗭}{z ≥ 0_{Z}}$ by $𝗭_{++}$. ⦉
