\ssection{Why}

We want to order the integers.

\ssection{Definition}

Consider $\eqc{(a, b)}, \eqc{(b, c)} \in \Z$.
If $a + d \leq b + c$, then we say that
$\eqc{(a, b)}$ is \t{less than} $\eqc{(b, c)}$.\footnote{One needs to show that this is well-defined. The account will appear in future editions.}
If $\eqc{(a, b)}$ is less than $\eqc{(b, c)}$ or equal, then we say that $\eqc{(a, b)}$ is \t{less than or equal to} $\eqc{(b, c)}$.

\ssection{Notation}

If $x, y \in \Z$ and $x$ is less than $y$, then we write $x < y$.
If $x$ is less than or equal to $y$, we write $x \leq y$.
