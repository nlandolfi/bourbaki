\ssection{Why}

We name multivariate normal densities which factor according to a tree.

\ssection{Definition}

A \t{tree multivariate normal} or \t{tree normal} density is a multivariate normal density which factors according to a tree.

% TODO: remove big O notation?
For a regular multivariate normal density on $\R^n$, we need to store $O(n^2)$ numbers (the covariance matrix).
For a tree normal on $\R^n$ we only need to store $O(n)$ real numbers.
