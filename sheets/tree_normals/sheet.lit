§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We name multivariate normal densities which factor according
    to a tree. ⦉

  ‖ These densities require tabulating fewer numbers. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬tree multivariate normal❭ (or ❬tree normal❭, ❬tree
    gaussian❭) density is a multivariate normal density which
    factors according to a tree. ⦉
⦉

§§ Fewer numbers ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A multivariate normal on $𝗥^n$ requires tabulating $n$
    numbers for the mean and $n(n+1)/2$ numbers for the
    covariance matrix. If it factors according to a tree, we
    need only $n$ numbers to specify the covariance (one for the
    one-variable marginal, and $n-1$ for the covariance of the
    two-variable conditionals). ⦉
