§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to define the length of a subset of real numbers. ⦉
⦉

§ Notions ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We take two common notions: ⦉
⦉

𝍫 ⦊
  ‣ ‖ The length of a whole is the sum of the lengths of its
      parts; the ❬additivity principle❭. ⦉⦉

  ‣ ‖ The length of a whole is the at least the length of any
      whole it contains the ❬containment principle❭. ⦉⦉
⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The task is to make precise the use of “whole,” “parts,”
    and “contains.” ⦉

  ‖ We start with intervals. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ By whole we mean set. ⦉

  ‖ By part we mean an element of a partition; in other words,
    a subset. ⦉

  ‖ By contains we mean set inclusion. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The length of an interval is the difference of its
    endpoints: the larger minus the smaller (see␣
    <a href='/sheets/interval_length.html'>
      ‖ Interval Length ⦉
    </a>
    ). ⦉

  ‖ Two intervals are ❬non-overlapping❭ if their intersection is
    a single point or empty. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬length❭ of the union of two non-overlapping intervals
    is the sum of their lengths. ⦉
⦉

<!--
% A \ct{simple}{} subset
% of the real numbers
% is a finite union
% of non-overlapping intervals.
% The length of a simple subset
% is the sum of the lengths of
% its family.
%
% A \ct{countably simple}{} subset
% of the real numbers
% is a countable union
% of non-overlapping intervals.
% The length of a countably simple subset
% is the limit of the sum of the lengths
% of its family; as we have defined it,
% length is positive, so this series is either
% bounded and increasing and so converges, or is
% infinite, and so converges to $+\infty$.
%
% At this point, we must confront the obvious
% question: are all subsets of the real numbers
% countably simple?
% Answer: no.
% So, what can we say?
%
% A \ct{cover}{}
% of a set $A$ of real numbers
% is a family whose union
% is a contains $A$.
% Since a cover always contains
% the set $A$, it's length, which
% we understand, must be larger
% (containment principles) than
% $A$.
% So what if we declare that
% the length of an arbitrary set
% $A$ be the greatest lower bound
% of the lengths of all sequences
% of intervals covering $A$.
% Will this work?
%
% \ssubsection{Cuts}
%
% If $a, b$ are real numbers and
% $a < b$, then we \ct{cut}{} an interval
% with $a$ and $b$ as its endpoints
% by selecting $c$ such that
% $a < c$ and $c < b$.
% We obtain two intervals, one with endpoints
% $a,c$ and one with endpoints $c, b$;
% we call these two the \ct{cut pieces}{}.
%
% Given an interval, the length of
% the interval is the sum of any
% two cut pieces, because the pieces
% are non-overlapping.
%
% \ssection{All sets}
%
%
%
% \begin{proposition}
%   Not all subsets of
%   real numbers are simple.
%
%   Exhibit: R is not finite.
% \end{proposition}
%
%
% \begin{proposition}
%   Not all subsets of
%   real numbers are countably simple.
%
%   Exhibit: the rationals.
% \end{proposition}
%
% Here's the great insight:
% approximate a set
% by a countable family of intervals.
