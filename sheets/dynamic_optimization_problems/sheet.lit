§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $𝒟 = ((𝒳_t)_{t = 0}^{T}), (𝒰_t)_{t=0}^{T-1},
    (f_t)_{t=1}^{T-1})$ be a dynamical system. ⦉

  ‖ Let $g_t: 𝒳_t × 𝒰_t → 𝗥 ∪ \set{∞}$ for $t = 1$, $…$,
    $T-1$ and let $g_{T}: 𝒳_T → 𝗥 ∪ \set{∞}$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $x_0 ∈ 𝒳_0$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We call the sequence $(x_0, 𝒟, (g_t)_{t = 1}^{T})$ a
    ❬deterministic dynamic optimization problem❭. ⦉

  ‖ We call $x_0$ the ❬initial state❭. ⦉

  ‖ We call $g_t$ the ❬stage cost function❭ for stage $t$ and
    call $g_T$ the ❬terminal cost function❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A deterministic dynamic optimization problem corresponds to an
    optimization problem with variables $u_0 ∈ 𝒰_0, …, u_{T-1} ∈
    𝒰_{T-1}$. ⦉

  ‖ Define $U = 𝒰_0 × 𝒰_1 × 𝒰_{T-1}$. ⦉

  ‖ Define $J: U → 𝗥 ∪ \set{∞}$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ J(u) = ∑_{t = 0}^{T-1} g_t(x_t, u_t) + g_T(x_T) ⦉
    ⦉
    in which $x_{t+1} = f_t(x_t, u_t)$ for $t = 0, …, T-1$. ⦉

  ‖ The optimization problem is $(U, J)$. ⦉

  ‖ And so a dynamic optimization problem is just a (possibly
    big) optimization problem. ⦉

  ‖ We call $∑_{t = 0}^{T-1} g_t(x_t, u_t)$ the ❬total stage
    cost❭ and we call $g_T(x_T)$ the ❬terminal stage cost❭. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We often write this problem as
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \begin{aligned} ⦉

      ‖ \text{minimize}\quad ＆ ∑_{t = 1}^{T-1} g_t(x_t, u_t) +
        g_T(x_T) ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ \text{subject to}\quad ＆ x_{t+1} = f_t(x_t, u_t), \quad t
        = 0, …, T-1. ⦉

      ‖ \end{aligned} ⦉

§ Other terminology and comments ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Dynamic optimization problems are frequently called
    ❬deterministic optimal control❭ problems or ❬classical❭ or
    ❬open-loop control❭ problems. ⦉

  ‖ These problems are said to address the dynamic effect of
    actions across time. ⦉

  ‖ Although these models include no notion of “uncertainty” (or
    “uncertain outcomes”, see␣
    <a href='/sheets/uncertain_outcomes.html'>
      ‖ Uncertain Outcomes ⦉
    </a>
    ), they are frequently applied in situations with uncertain
    outcomes by ignoring the uncertainty in the application. ⦉
