§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $Z$ and $X$ be sets, either of which may or may not
    be finite. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬latent generation pair❭ from ❬latents❭ $Z$ to
    ❬observations❭ $X$ is an ordered pair $(p_z, p_{x |z})$ whose
    first coordinate is a distribution (density) on $Z$ and whose
    second coordinate is a conditional distribution (density) on
    $X$ from $Z$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬joint function❭ $p_{zx}: Z ×X → 𝗥$ of the pair is
    defined by $p_{zx}(ζ, ξ) = p_{z}(ζ)p_{x |z}(ξ, ζ)$ for all
    $ξ ∈ X$ and $ζ ∈ Z$. ⦉

  ‖ It is a distribution (density) if (not only if) both
    $p_{z}$ and $p_{x |z}$ are distributions (densities). ⦉

  ‖ Regardless, we define the ❬marginal function❭ $p_x: X → 𝗥$
    by $p_x(ξ) = ∈t_Z p_{zx}(ξ, ·)$. ⦉

  ‖ It too may be a distribution, density, or neither. ⦉

  ‖ In cases we construct, it is often  a distribution or a
    density, but it need not be either. ⦉
⦉

§§ Interpretation as distribution graph ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The latent generation pairs from $Z$ to $X$ are isomorphic
    to the graph distributions whose typed graph $(\set{1, 2},
    \set{(1,2)}), (Z, x)$.

§ Parametrizations ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ By parameterizing either or both of the coordinates of the
    pair, we have ❬latent generation family❭. ⦉
⦉

§§ Other terminology ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Other terminology for latent generation pair includes ❬latent
    variable model❭. ⦉

  ‖ Some authorities refer to the marginal function as the
    ❬generative model❭, still others use this term to refer to
    the pair. ⦉
⦉

<!--
%A \t{probabilistic generating pair family} is a family of latent distributions $\set{(\set{p^{(\theta)}_z}, \set{p^{(\theta)}_{x \mid z}})}_{\theta \in \Theta}$.
%In this case we denote the joint function $p_{zx}^{(\theta)}$ to indicate the dependence on the \t{parameters} $\theta$.
