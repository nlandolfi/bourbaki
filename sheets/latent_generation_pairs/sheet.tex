\section*{Definition}

Let $Z$ and $X$ be sets, either of which may or may not be finite.

A \t{latent generation pair} from \t{latents} $Z$ to \t{observations} $X$ is an ordered pair $(p_z, p_{x \mid z})$ whose first coordinate is a distribution (density) on $Z$ and whose second coordinate is a conditional distribution (density) on $X$ from $Z$.

The \t{joint function} $p_{zx}: Z \times X \to \R $ of the pair is defined by $p_{zx}(\zeta , \xi ) = p_{z}(\zeta )p_{x \mid z}(\xi , \zeta )$ for all $\xi  \in X$ and $\zeta  \in Z$.
It is a distribution (density) if (not only if) both $p_{z}$ and $p_{x \mid z}$ are distributions (densities).
Regardless, we define the \t{marginal function} $p_x: X \to \R $ by $p_x(\xi ) = \int_Z p_{zx}(\xi , \cdot )$.
It too may be a distribution, density, or neither.
In cases we construct, it is often a distribution or a density, but it need not be either.

\subsection*{Interpretation as distribution graph}

The latent generation pairs from $Z$ to $X$ are isomorphic to the graph distributions whose typed graph $(\set{1, 2}, \set{(1,2)}), (Z, x)$.\footnote{Future editions will include a visualization.}

\section*{Parametrizations}

By parameterizing either or both of the coordinates of the pair, we have \t{latent generation family}.

\subsection*{Other terminology}

Other terminology for latent generation pair includes \t{latent variable model}.
Some authorities refer to the marginal function as the \t{generative model}, still others use this term to refer to the pair.

%%A \t{probabilistic generating pair family} is a family of latent distributions $\set{(\set{p^{(\theta)}_z}, \set{p^{(\theta)}_{x \mid z}})}_{\theta \in \Theta}$.
%%In this case we denote the joint function $p_{zx}^{(\theta)}$ to indicate the dependence on the \t{parameters} $\theta$.
