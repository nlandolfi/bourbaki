§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We can add and scale matrices, so the $m × n$ matrices
    are a vector space over $𝗥$. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬matrix sum❭ of two matrices $A, B ∈ 𝗥^{m × n}$ is
    the matrix $C ∈ 𝗥^{m × n}$ defined by $C_{ij} = A_{ij} +
    B_{ij}$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, the matrix $C$ is given by summing the
    entries of $A$ and $B$ “entry-wise”. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the matrix sum by $A + B$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ For $α ∈ 𝗥$, the ❬$α$-scaling❭ of $A ∈ 𝗥^{m × n}$ is the
    matrix $C ∈ 𝗥^{m × n}$ defined by $C_{ij} = α A_{ij}$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, the matrix $C$ is given by scaling the
    entries of $A$ “entry-wise”. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the $α$-scaled version of $A$ by $α A$. ⦉

  ‖ These two definitions are justified by the following. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬matrix space❭ (or ❬matrix vector space❭) is the vector
    space $𝗥^{m × n}$ in which addition is given by the matrix
    sums and scalar multiplication by entry-wise scaling. ⦉

  ‖ Sometimes we reference explicitly the ❬$m×n$ matrix space❭. ⦉
⦉

§§ Subspaces of symmetric matrices ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Consider the space of square matrices $𝗥^{n × n}$. ⦉

  ‖ It is obvious that the subset of symmetric matrices is a
    subspace. ⦉

  ‖ Adding two symmetric matrices gives a symmetric matrix. ⦉

  ‖ Scaling a symmetric matrix by a real number gives a
    symmetric matrix. ⦉

  ‖ The matrix all of whose entries are 0 is symmetric. ⦉
