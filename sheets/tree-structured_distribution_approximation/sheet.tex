\ssection{Why}

\ssection{Problem Statement}

Tree-structured distribution
approximation is a mathematical
optimization problem in which we
find a tree-structured distribution
which minimizes its entropy relative
to a given distribution over the set
of all distributions which factor
according to trees.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $A_1, \dots, A_n$ be
non-empty sets.
Let $q$ be a distribution on
$\prod_{i = 1}^{n} A_i$.
Let $d$ denote the relative
entropy.

We want to find a distribution $p$
on $A$ and tree $T$ on
$\set{1, \dots, n}$ to
\[
  \begin{aligned}
    \text{minimize}   &\quad d(q, p) \\
    \text{subject to} &\quad p \text{ factors according to the tree } T
  \end{aligned}
\]
