§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want a form of the dominated convergence theorem in
    terms of convergence in measure.

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A sequence of real-valued measurable functions ❬converges in
    measure❭ to a real-valued measurable limit function if for
    every positive number the measures of the set where the
    function deviates from the limit function by more than the
    positive number converges to zero. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $\seq{f}$ is a sequence of real-valued measurable
    funtions on a measure space $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ and $f: X → 𝗥$
    measurable. ⦉

  ‖ If $f_n$ converges in measure to $f$ we write: $f_n ⟶ f$
    in measure, read aloud as “$f_n$ goes to $f$ in measure.” ⦉

  ‖ This notation is an abbreviation of the following relation
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \lim_{n → ∞} μ(\Set*{x ∈ X}{\abs{f_n(x) - f(x)} > ϵ}) =
        0 \quad \text{ for all } ϵ > 0 ⦉
