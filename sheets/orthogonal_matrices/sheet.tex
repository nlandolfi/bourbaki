\ssection{Definition}

An \t{orthonormal} (or \t{orthogonal}) matrix is a matrix whose columns are an orthonormal family of vectors.

Some authors call these \t{real orthogonal} or \t{unitary} matrices.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $A \in \Mat{\F}{m}{n}$.
Something something
\[
  A\transpose{A} = I.
\]

\ssection{Characterizations}

\begin{proposition}

  A matrix is orthonormal if and only if its transpose product with the matrix is the identity.

\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}

A matrix is orthonormal if and only if its transpose is orthonormal.

\end{proposition}
