§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We often want a subset system whose set of distinguished
    subsets is closed under the usual set operations. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬subset algebra❭ is a subset system for which (1) the
    base set is distinguished (2) the complement of a
    distinguished set is distinguished (3) the union of two
    distinguished sets is distinguished. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We call the set of distinguished sets an ❬algebra❭ on the
    the base set. ⦉

  ‖ We justify this language by showing that the standard set
    operations applied to distinguished sets result in
    distinguished sets. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ If a set of subsets is closed under complements it contains
    the base set if and only if it contains the empty set. ⦉

  ‖ So we can replace condition (1) by insisting that the
    algebra contain the empty set. ⦉

  ‖ Similarly, if a non-empty set of subsets is closed under
    complements and unions then it contains the base set: the
    union of a distinguished set and its complement. ⦉

  ‖ Thus we can replace condition (1) by insisting that the
    algebra be non-empty. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The notation follows that of a subset system. ⦉

  ‖ Let $(A, 𝒜)$ be a subset algebra. ⦉

  ‖ We also say “let $𝒜$ be an algebra on $A$.” ⦉

  ‖ Moreover, since the largest element of the algebra is the
    base set, we can say without ambiguity: “let $𝒜$ be an
    algebra.” ⦉
⦉

§ Properties ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ For any subset algebra, $∅$ is distinguished. ⦉
</statement>
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ For any subset algebra, ⦉

  ‖ for any distinguished sets, ⦉

  ‖ (a) the intersection is distinguished and ⦉

  ‖ (b) their symmetric difference is distinguished. ⦉

  ‖ So, if one contains the other, the complement ⦉

  ‖ of the smaller in the larger is distinguished. ⦉
</statement>
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ For any subset algebra, ⦉

  ‖ for any finite family of distinguished sets, ⦉

  ‖ (a) the finite family union and ⦉

  ‖ (b) the finite family intersection ⦉

  ‖ are both distinguished. ⦉
</statement>
¶ ⦊
  ‖ So we could have defined an algebra ⦉

  ‖ by insisting it be closed under finite ⦉

  ‖ intersections. ⦉
