\ssection{Why}

We name a function which preserves algebraic structure.

\ssection{Definition}

A \t{group homomorphism} between two groups is a function
$(A, +)$ and
$(B, \tilde{+})$
is a bijection $f: A \to B$ such that
$f(1_A) = f(1_B)$ for  $1_A \in A$
and $1_B \in B$ and $f(a + a') = f(a) \tilde{+} f(a')$
for all $a, a' \in A$.
Similarlly we define \t{ring homomorphism} and \t{field homomorphisms}.
