\stitle{Set Symmetric Differences}

\ssection{Why}

We want to consider the elements of a set and another set which are in either, but not in both.

\ssection{Definition}

The \t{symmetric difference} of a set with another set is the union of the difference between the latter set and the former set and the difference between teh former and the latter.
