§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ An operator $T ∈ ℒ(V)$ is called ❬self-adjoint❭ (or
    ❬Hermitian❭) if the adjoint of $T$ is itself. ⦉

  ‖ In symbols, $T$ is self-adjoint if $T = T^*$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, $T$ is self-adjoint if and only if
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \ip{Tv, w} = \ip{v, Tw} \quad \text{for all } v, w ∈ V ⦉

§§ Properties ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Suppose $S, T ∈ ℒ(V)$ are self-adjoint. ⦉

  ‖ The $S + T$ are self-adjoint. ⦉

  ‖ Also $λT$ is adjoint for all ‹real› $λ$. ⦉
</statement>

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We will see that the adjoint on $ℒ(V)$ plays a role
    similar to complex conjugation on $𝗖$. ⦉

  ‖ The self-adjoint operators will seen to be analogous to the
    real numbers. ⦉

  ‖ A complex number is real if and only if $z = \Cconj{z}$. ⦉

  ‖ Similarly, an operator is self-adjoint if and only if $T =
    T^*$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Characterization for complex space ⦉

<!-- the following is axler 7.15 -->
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Suppose $V$ is a complex inner product space and let $T ∈
    ℒ(V)$. ⦉

  ‖ Then
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ T = T^* \quad \iff \quad (∀ v ∈ V)\;(\ip{Tv, v} ∈ 𝗥) ⦉
    ⦉⦉
