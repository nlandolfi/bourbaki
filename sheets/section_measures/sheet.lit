§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Toward a theory of iterated integrals, we need to know the
    function measuring a section is integrable. ⦉

§ Results ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ and $(Y, ℬ, ν)$ be sigma-finite measurable
    spaces. ⦉

  ‖ Let $E ∈ 𝒜 × ℬ$. ⦉

  ‖ The function $x ↦ ν(E_x)$ is $𝒜$-measurable and the function
    $y ↦ μ(E^y)$ is $ℬ$-measurable. ⦉
