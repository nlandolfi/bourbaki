\ssection{Why}

We are constantly thinking of the $\R^2$ as points of a plane.\footnote{Future editions will modify this sheet.}

\ssection{Discussion}

We think of elements of $\R^2$ as being points of a plane from \sheetref{geometry}{Geometry}.
For this reason we sometimes call the elements of $\R^2$ \t{points}.
