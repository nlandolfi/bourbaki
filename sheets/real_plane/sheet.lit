§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We are constantly thinking of the elements of $𝗥^2$ as
    points of a plane.

§ Discussion ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We commonly associate elements of $𝗥^2$ with points on a
    plane. (see \sheetref{geometry}{Geometry}). ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ \begin{principle}[Line Sets] ⦉

  ‖ Given a plane, there exists a set of its (infinite) lines. ⦉

  ‖ \end{principle} ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ \begin{principle}[Real Plane Correspondence] ⦉

  ‖ Let $L$ be the set of lines of a plane. ⦉

  ‖ Then $∪ L$ is the set of points of the plane. ⦉

  ‖ There exists a one-to-one correspondence mapping elements of
    $∪ L$ onto elements of $𝗥^2$. ⦉

  ‖ \end{principle} ⦉

  ‖ For this reason, we sometimes call elements of $𝗥^2$
    ❬points❭. ⦉

  ‖ We call the point associated with $(0, 0)$ the ❬origin❭. ⦉

  ‖ We call the element of $𝗥^2$ which corresponds to a point
    the ❬coordinates❭ of the point. ⦉
⦉

§ Visualization ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ To visualize the correspondence we draw two perpendicular
    lines. ⦉

  ‖ We then associate a point of the line with $(0, 0) ∈ 𝗥^2$. ⦉

  ‖ We can label it so. ⦉

  ‖ We then pick a unit length. ⦉

  ‖ And proceed as usual.

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given that we have identified a plane with $𝗥^2$ in this
    way, we call $(x, y) ∈ 𝗥^2$ the ❬coordinates❭ of the point
    it corresponds to. ⦉

  ‖ Many authors refer to this identification as a ❬Cartesian
    coordinate system❭ (or ❬Rectangular coordinate system❭, ❬$x$-$y$
    coordinate system❭). ⦉
