\ssection{Definition}

An \t{orthonormal} matrix is a matrix whose columns are an orthonormal family of vectors.

Some authors call these \t{orthogonal} matrices or \t{real orthogonal} or \t{unitary} matrices.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $A \in \Mat{\F}{m}{n}$.
Something something
$$
  AA^T = I.
$$

\ssection{Characterizations}

\begin{prop}

  A matrix is orthonormal if and only if its transpose product with the matrix is the identity.

\end{prop}

\begin{prop}

A matrix is orthonormal if and only if its transpose is orthonormal.

\end{prop}
