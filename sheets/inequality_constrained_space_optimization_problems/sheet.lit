§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ An optimization problem is $(X, f)$ is an ❬inequality
    constrained space optimization problem❭ if $X ⊂ 𝗥^n$, $f: 𝗥^n
    → 𝗥$, and there exists $g: 𝗥^n → 𝗥^m$ so that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ X = \Set{x ∈ 𝗥^n}{g(x) ≤ 0} ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ For this reason, $(f, g)$ is sometimes called the ❬problem
    data❭ (❬abstract problem data❭) of the problem. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We often write such problems as: given $f: 𝗥^n → 𝗥$ and
    $g: 𝗥^n → 𝗥^m$, find $x ∈ 𝗥^n$ to
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \begin{aligned} ⦉

      ‖ \text{minimize} & \quad f(x) ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ \text{subject to} & \quad g(x) ≤ 0 ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ \end{aligned} ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Some authors abbreviate inequality constrained space
    optimization problem as ICP. ⦉

§§ Handles equality constraints ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $f: 𝗥^n → 𝗥$ and $h: 𝗥^n → 𝗥^m$ are the
    (abstract) problem data for an ‹equality› constrained space
    optimization problem. ⦉

  ‖ Define $g: 𝗥^n → 𝗥^{2m}$ so that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ g(x) = (h(x), -h(x)) \quad \text{for all } x ∈ 𝗥^n ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Then the ECP $(f, h)$ and ICP $(f, g)$ have the same
    feasible set and optimal solutions. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, given an equality constrained problem we can
    always write it as an inequality constrained problem. ⦉
