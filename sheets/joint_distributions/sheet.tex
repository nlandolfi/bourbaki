\ssection{Why}

We want to model several random variables of interest at once.\footnote{Future editions will modify this, avoiding the use of the term random variable.}

\ssection{Definition}

Consider a distribution over a product of $n$ sets, where the product is indexed by the first $n$ natural numbers.
We call the distribution a \t{joint distribution} with $n$ components.
