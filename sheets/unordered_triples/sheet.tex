\s{Why}

$\set{a} \union \set{b} = \set{a, b}$

\s{Definition}

Let $a$, $b$ and $c$ denote objects.
From the associativity of pair unions (see \sheetref{pair_unions}{Pair Unions}), we have
\[
  (\set{a} \union \set{b}) \union \set{b} = \set{a} \union (\set{b} \union \set{c}).
\]
So we will drop the parentheses, and write $\set{a} \union \set{b} \union \set{c}$.
We call such a set the \t{unordered triple} of $a$, $b$ and $c$.
The unordered triple of $a$, $b$ and $c$ is the set containing these elements and no others.

\ss{Notation}

Such sets are so commonplace that we denote the unordered triple of $a$, $b$ and $c$ by $\set{a, b, c}$.

\s{Quadruples}

Let $d$ denote an object.
Again, the associativity of pair unions allows us to drop the parentheses from 
\[
  (((\set{a} \union \set{b}) \union \set{c}) \union \set{d})).
\]
We can therefore write $\set{a} \union \set{b} \union \set{c} \union \set{d}$ without ambiguity.
We call this set the \t{unordered quadruple}.
As before, the unordered quadruple contains of $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ contains $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ and nothing besides these.

\ss{Notation} 
We denote the unordered quadruple of the objected denoted by $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$, denote this set by $\set{a, b, c, d}$.

\s{The case of several named objects}

In a similar way we speak of \t{unordered pentuples}, \t{unordered sextuples}, \t{unordered septuples} and so on.
If we have several objects named, we denote the set containing these objects be writing their names in between the left brace $\{$ and right brace$\}$, separating the names by commas.
For example, if we $A$, $b$, $x$ and $Y$ and $z$ denote objects, then we denote the set containing these elements by
\[
	\set{A, b, x, Y, z}.
\]
