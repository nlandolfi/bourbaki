§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The (normalized) sum of several independent and identically
    distributed random variables tends toward a normal
    distribution.

§ Result ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ ⦉

  ‖ be a probability space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $\seq{f}$ be a sequence ⦉

  ‖ of independent and identically ⦉

  ‖ distributed real-valued ⦉

  ‖ random variables on $X$ ⦉

  ‖ with ⦉

  ‖ $𝗘(\seqt{f}) = μ < ∞$ ⦉

  ‖ and ⦉

  ‖ $\var(\seqt{f}) = σ^2 < ∞$ ⦉

  ‖ for all $n$. ⦉

  ‖ Define $s_n = ∑_{i = 1}^{n}f_i$. ⦉

  ‖ For all real numbers $t$,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \lim_{n → ∞} μ\Set*{ x ∈ X }{ \frac{ s_n(x) - nμ }{
        σ√{n} } ≤ t } = Φ(t). ⦉
