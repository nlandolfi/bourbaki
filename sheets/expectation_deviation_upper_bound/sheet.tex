\ssection{Why}

We bound the probability
that a random variance
deviates from its mean
using its variance.

\ssection{Result}

\begin{prop}
Let $f$ be a
square-integrable
real-valued
random variable
on the probability
space $(X, \SA, \mu)$.
Then for $t > 0$,
\[
  \mu\parens*{\abs{f - \Expect(f)} \geq t} \leq \frac{\var f}{t^2}.
\]
\begin{proof}
The set
$\abs{f - \Expect(f)} \geq t$
is
$\Set*{x \in X}{ \abs{f(x) - \Expect(f)} \geq t}$.
This set is
$\Set*{x \in X}{({f(x) - \Expect(f)})^2 \geq t^2}$.
By using the non-negative inequality
\[
  \mu(\Set*{x \in X}{({f(x) - \Expect(f)})^2 \geq t^2}) \leq \frac{\Expect(f - \Expect(f))}{t^2}.
\]
We recognize the numerator of the right
hand side as the variance.
\end{proof}
\end{prop}

The above is also called \t{Chebychev's Inequality}.
