\section*{Why}

We bound the probability that a random variance deviates from its mean using its variance.

\section*{Result}

\begin{proposition}
Let $f$ be a square-integrable real-valued random variable on the probability space $(X, \mathcal{A} , \mu )$.
Then for $t > 0$,
\[
\mu [\abs{f - \E (f)} \geq t] \leq \frac{\var f}{t^2}.
\]
\begin{proof}The symbols $\abs{f - \E (f)} \geq t$ denote the set $\Set*{x \in X}{ \abs{f(x) - \E (f)} \geq t}$.
This set is the same as the set
\[
\Set*{x \in X}{({f(x) - \E (f)})^2 \geq t^2}.
\]
By using the \sheetref{tail_measure_upper_bound}{tail measure upper bound},
\[
\mu (\Set*{x \in X}{({f(x) - \E (f)})^2 \geq t^2}) \leq \frac{\E (f - \E (f))^2}{t^2}.
\]
We recognize the numerator of the right hand side as the \sheetref{variance}{variance}of $f$.\end{proof}
\end{proposition}

The above is also called \t{Chebychev's Inequality}.
