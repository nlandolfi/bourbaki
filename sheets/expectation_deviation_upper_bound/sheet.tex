\section*{Why}

We bound the probability
that a random variance
deviates from its mean
using its variance.

\section*{Result}

\begin{proposition}
Let $f$ be a
square-integrable
real-valued
random variable
on the probability
space $(X, \mathcal{A} , \mu )$.
Then for $t > 0$,
  \[
\mu (\abs{f - \E (f)} \geq t) \leq \frac{\var f}{t^2}.
  \]
\begin{proof}The set
$\abs{f - \E (f)} \geq t$
is
$\Set*{x \in X}{ \abs{f(x) - \E (f)} \geq t}$.
This set is
$\Set*{x \in X}{({f(x) - \E (f)})^2 \geq t^2}$.
By using the non-negative inequality
  \[
\mu (\Set*{x \in X}{({f(x) - \E (f)})^2 \geq t^2}) \leq \frac{\E (f - \E (f))}{t^2}.
  \]
We recognize the numerator of the right
hand side as the variance.\end{proof}\end{proposition}
The above is also called \t{Chebychev's Inequality}.
