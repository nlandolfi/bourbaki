\section*{Why}

We bound the probability that a random variance deviates from its mean using its variance.

% TODO: assumptions of integrability 

\begin{proposition}
Suppose $f: \Omega  \to \R $ is measurable on the probability space $(\Omega , \mathcal{F} , P)$.
Then
\[
P[\abs{f - \E (f)} \geq t] \leq \frac{\var f}{t^2} \quad \text{ for all } t > 0
\]
\begin{proof}The symbols $\abs{f - \E (f)} \geq t$ denote the set $\Set*{x \in X}{ \abs{f(x) - \E (f)} \geq t}$.
This set is the same as the set
\[
\Set*{x \in X}{({f(x) - \E (f)})^2 \geq t^2}.
\]
By using the \sheetref{tail_measure_upper_bound}{tail measure upper bound},
\[
P(\Set*{x \in X}{({f(x) - \E (f)})^2 \geq t^2})
\leq
\frac{\E (f - \E (f))^2}{t^2}.
\]
We recognize the numerator of the right hand side as the \sheetref{variance}{variance}of $f$.\end{proof}
\end{proposition}

The above is also called \t{Chebychev's Inequality} (or the \t{Chebyshev inequality}).
