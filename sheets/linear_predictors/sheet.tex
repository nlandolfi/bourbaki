\ssection{Why}

Here's a simple idea.
If the set of postcepts is a vector space, use a predictor that is a linear transformation.\footnote{Future editions will expand on this why.}

\ssection{Definition}

A \t{linear predictor} is a predictor which is linear in the precepts.

\ssection{Example}

Suppose that the set of precepts is $\R^d$, for some $d \in \N$.
