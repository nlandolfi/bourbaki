\section*{Definition}

Let $\Sigma $ be a finite set (alphabet).
A \t{formal language} (or \t{language}) is a subset of finite-length strings of elements of $\Sigma $.

\subsection*{Examples}

Let $\Sigma  = \set{0,1}$.
Then $\varnothing$ is a language, as are the sets $\set{0, 1}$ and $\set{01, 001, 111, 1101010}$.

\subsection*{Notation}

We denote the finite strings of $\Sigma $ by $\str(\Sigma )$.
Other common notation is $\Sigma ^*$, which we avoid in these sheets for its collision with adjoints.
