\ssection{Why}\footnote{Future editions will include.}

\ssection{Definition}

A \t{neural network} is a sequence of functions from  with several properties.
First, the codomain and domain of two subsequence functions in the sequence match.
Second, each function is a composition of a function wit
We associate a neural network with a predictor which is the composition of the functions in the sequence.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $g^1: \R^d \to \R^k$, $g^2: \R^k \to \R^k$, $g^3: \R^k \to \R^m$.
Then $(g^1, g^2, g^3)$ is a neural network.
Notice that the codomain of $g^1$ ($\R^k$

\ssubsection{Activation functions}

An activation function $h: \R \to \R$ is nonlinear.
