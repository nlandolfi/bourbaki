\section*{Definition}

Consider a set of two or more random variables.
Two random variables in this set \t{dependent} if they are not conditionally independent, given all the other variables.\footnote{Future editions need a sheet on conditional independence.}
Call the undirected graph induced by this relation the \t{conditional dependency graph} of the random variables.
