\ssection{Definition}

Consider a set of two or more random variables.
Two random variables in this set \t{dependent} if they are not conditionally independent, given all the other variables.
  \ifhmode\unskip\fi\footnote{
Future editions need a sheet on conditional independence.
  }
Call the undirected graph induced by this relation the \t{conditional dependency graph} of the random variables.
