§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to talk about particular attributes of an outcome,
    instead of the details of the outcomes themselves. ⦉

  ‖ These may be useful to specify events. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ An ❬outcome variable❭ (or ❬random variable❭) is a function
    from $Ω$ to $V$, where $V$ is a set. ⦉

  ‖ In this context, $V$ is called the set of ❬values❭ of the
    random variable. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Standard convention denotes outcome random variables by
    capitals $X, Y, Z$ and elements of their codomain by
    corresponding lower-case, $x, y, z$. ⦉

  ‖ Thus, if $X: Ω → V$ is a random variable then the lower
    case $x$ is often reserved for an element of $V$. ⦉

  ‖ The event $\Set{ω ∈ Ω}{X(ω) = x}$, where $x ∈ V$, is
    often abbreviated $\set{X = x}$. ⦉

  ‖ The probability of this event is often abbreviated $P(X =
    x)$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Similarly, for a subset $A ⊂ V$, the event $\Set{ω ∈
    Ω}{X(ω) ∈ A}$ is often abbreviated $\set{X ∈ A}$ and its
    probability abbreviated $P(X ∈ A)$.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Occasionally, in the present edition of these sheets, we
        use the notation $P[X = a]$. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ If $X: Ω → V_1$ and $Y: Ω → V_2$, and $A ⊂ V_1$ and $B
    ⊂ V_2$, then the event $\set{X ∈ A} ∩ \set{Y ∈ B}$ is
    often written $\set{X ∈ A, Y ∈ B}$. ⦉
⦉

§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ ‹Sum of two dice.› ⦉

  ‖ Suppose we model rolling two dice. ⦉

  ‖ We are interested in the sum of the pips shown facing up. ⦉

  ‖ Suppose we take as the set of outcome $\set{1, …, 12}$,
    whose elements correspond to the sum. ⦉

  ‖ We interpret $\Set{x ∈ Ω}{x ≥ 10}$ as the event that the
    sum of the two dice is greater than or equal to 10. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Alternatively, we may take the usual set of outcomes
    $\set{1, …, 6}^2$ and define an outcome variable $s: \set{1,
    …, 6}^2 → \set{1, …, 12}$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ s(d_1, d_2) = d_1 + d_2. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ We interpret this natural-number-valued outcome variable $s$
    as sum of the two dice. ⦉

  ‖ The event that the sum of the two dice is greater than or
    equal to to 10 corresponds to the set $\Set{(d_1, d_2) ∈
    \set{1, …, 6}}{s(d_1, d_2) ≥ 10}$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ As a third alternative, again take the usual set of
    outcomes $Ω = \set{1, …, 6}^2$. ⦉

  ‖ Define the outcome variable $X: Ω → 𝗡$ to be the number
    of pips showing on the first die, $Y: Ω → 𝗡$ to be the
    number of pips showing on the second die, and define $Z: Ω
    → 𝗡$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ Z(ω) = X(ω) + Y(ω) \quad \text{for all } ω ∈ Ω ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ A standard notation for this relation between $Z$ and $X,Y$
    by $Z = X + Y$. ⦉

  ‖ For example, if $ω = (2,5)$, $X(ω) = 2$, $Y(ω) = 5$, and
    $Z(ω) = 7$. ⦉

  ‖ The event $\set{Z = 4}$ is the set $\set{(2,2), (1,3),
    (3,1)}$ ⦉

  ‖ If we take the usual distribution $p$ on $Ω$ with $p(ω) =
    1/36$ for every $ω$, the the probability of this event is
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ P(Z = 4) = p(2,2) + p(1,3) + p(3, 1) = 1/36+1/36+1/36
        = 1/12 ⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The preceding three paragraphs highlight that there are
    several ways of denoting the same situation. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ ‹Tossing a fair coin $n$ times.› ⦉

  ‖ As before, we model $n$ tosses of a fair coin with the
    sample space $Ω = \set{0,1}^n$. ⦉

  ‖ Define $X_i: Ω → \set{0,1}$ by $X_i(ω) = ω_i$. ⦉

  ‖ We interpret $\Set{ω ∈ Ω}{X_i(ω) = 1}$ as the event that
    toss $i$ turns up heads, and likewise $\Set{ω ∈ Ω}{X_i(ω) =
    0}$ as the event that toss $i$ turns up tails, for $i =
    1, …, n$. ⦉

  ‖ We can define the function $X: Ω → {0,1}^n$ by $X(ω) = ω$
    or by saying $X = (X_1, …, X_n)$. ⦉

  ‖ Suppose we define $H: Ω → 𝗡$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ H(ω) = ∑_{i= 1}^{n} X_i(ω) ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Or, alternatively, $H = ∑_{i = 1}^{n} X_i$. ⦉

  ‖ In this case, we interpret $H$ as the number of heads
    observed in the $n$ tosses. ⦉
