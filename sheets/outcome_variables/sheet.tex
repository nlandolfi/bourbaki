\ssection{Why}

How should we talk about objects which are associated with some uncertain outcome?

\ssection{Definition}

We use the language of functions
Let $\Omega $ be a set of outcomes.
An \t{outcome variable} (or \t{random variable}) is a function on a set of outcomes $\Omega $.
We call the codomain of the function the set of \t{values} of the outcome variable.
If the set is named \_, we call the function a \_-valued outcome variable on $\Omega $.

\ssubsection{Example: two dice}

Model the outcomes of the number of pips facing up after rolling two dice with the set $\set{1, \dots, 6}^2$.
Define the outcome variable $s: \set{1, \dots, 6}^2 \to \set{1, \dots, 12}$ by
  \[
s((d_1, d_2)) = d_1 + d_2.
  \]
We interpret the outcome variable $s$ as the sum of the two dice.
