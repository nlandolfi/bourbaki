\ssection{Why}

We want to talk about objects associated with an uncertain outcome.
We use a correspondence between each outcome and objects of another set.

\ssection{Definition}

Let $\Omega$ be a set of outcomes.
An \t{outcome variable} is function whose domain is $\Omega$.
We call the codomain of the function the set of values.
The standard terminology is to refer to an outcome variable as a \t{random variable}.\footnote{Future editions may do so. For now, this is avoided in contrast with the notion of measurability required for random variables.}

\subsection{Example: two dice}

Let $D = \set{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}$.
Consider the set of outcomes $A = D \times D$.
An outcome variable associated with $A$ is the function $s: A \to \N$ which is defined by
\[
  s((d_1, d_2)) = d_1 + d_2.
\]
We interpret the outcome variable $s$ as the sum of the two dice.
