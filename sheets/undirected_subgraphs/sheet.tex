\ssection{Why}

We often start with an undirected graph and want to talk about the graphs we obtain by only keeping the edges incident to particular vertices.

\ssection{Definition}

The \t{subgraph} of a graph corresponding to a subset of vertices is the undirected graph with those vertices and all edges between those vertices.

\ssection{Notation}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph.
Let $W \subset V$.
The subgraph corresponding to $W$ is the undirected graph $(W, F)$ where
$$F = \Set*{\set{v, w} \in E}{v, w \in W}.$$
TODO: maybe delete; this abuses $G$, which is no longer an ordered pair, but becomes a function on subsets of $V$ with a complicated codomain.
We denote the subgraph of $G$ corresponding to $W$ by $G(W) = (W, E(W))$.
