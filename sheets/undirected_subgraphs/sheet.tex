\ssection{Why}

We look at a particular subset of vertices and the edges involved between them.

\ssection{Definition}

The \t{subgraph} of an undirected graph $(V, E)$ \t{induced by} a subset of vertices $W \subset V$ is the undirected graph with vertices $W$ and all edges between vertices in $W$.

\ssection{Notation}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph.
Let $W \subset V$.
\[
  F = \Set*{\set{v, w} \in E}{v, w \in W}.
\]
The subgraph induced by $W$ is the undirected graph $(W, F)$.

Some authors denote the subgraph induced by $W$ by $G(W)$ or $(W, E(W))$.
We avoid this notation, as it abuses $G$, which is no longer an ordered pair, but (in our standard function notation) now indicates a function on subsets of $V$ with a complicated codomain.
Other authors occasionally refer to the \say{subgraph $W$}, instead of \say{the subgraph $G(W)$}.
Again, we avoid this practice.
