§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We list some principles which our intuition of area in
    planar geometry satisfies. ⦉
⦉

§ Common notions ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We take two common notions; these are analagous to those we
    developed for length. ⦉
  𝍫 ⦊
    ‣ ‖ The area of the whole is the sum of the area of the parts;
        the ❬additivity principle❭. ⦉⦉

    ‣ ‖ If one whole contains another, the first’s area at least as
        large as the second's area; the ❬containment principle❭. ⦉⦉
  ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Again, the task is to make precise the use of “whole,”
    “parts,” and “contains.” We start with rectangles. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬area❭ of an rectangle is the sum of the lengths of
    its sides. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Two rectangles are ❬non-overlapping❭ if their intersection is
    a single point or empty. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬area❭ of the union of two non-overlapping intervals is
    the sum of their areas. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬simple❭ subset of the real numbers is a finite union of
    non-overlapping intervals. ⦉

  ‖ The length of a simple subset is the sum of the lengths
    of its family. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬countably simple❭ subset of the real numbers is a
    countable union of non-overlapping intervals. ⦉

  ‖ The length of a countably simple subset is the limit of
    the sum of the lengths ⦉

  ‖ of its family; as we have defined it, length is positive,
    so this series is either bounded and increasing and so
    converges, or is infinite, and so converges to $+∈fty$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ At this point, we must confront the obvious question: are
    all subsets of the real numbers countably simple? ⦉

  ‖ Answer: no. ⦉

  ‖ So, what can we say? ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬cover❭ of a set $A$ of real numbers is a family whose
    union is a contains $A$. Since a cover always contains the
    set $A$, it's length, which we understand, must be larger
    (containment principles) than $A$. ⦉

  ‖ So what if we declare that the length of an arbitrary set
    $A$ be the greatest lower bound of the lengths of all
    sequences of intervals covering $A$. Will this work? ⦉
⦉

§§ Cuts ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ If $a, b$ are real numbers and $a < b$, then we ❬cut❭ an
    interval with $a$ and $b$ as its endpoints by selecting $c$
    such that $a < c$ and $c < b$. ⦉

  ‖ We obtain two intervals, one with endpoints $a,c$ and one
    with endpoints $c, b$; we call these two the ❬cut pieces❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given an interval, the length of the interval is the sum
    of any two cut pieces, because the pieces are non-overlapping. ⦉
⦉

§ All sets ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Not all subsets of real numbers are simple. ⦉
  ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Exhibit: R is not finite. ⦉

</statement>
<statement type='proposition'>
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Not all subsets of real numbers are countably simple. ⦉
  ⦉

  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Exhibit: the rationals. ⦉
  ⦉
</statement>
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Here's the great insight: approximate a set by a countable
    family of intervals. ⦉
