§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We generalize the algebraic structure of addition and
    multiplication over the rationals. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬field❭ is a ring $(R, +, · )$ for which $· $ is
    commutative (i.e., $ab = ba$ for all $a, b ∈ R$) and $· $
    has inverses for all elements except $0$. ⦉

  ‖ In this case, we refer to ❬field addition❭ and ❬field
    multiplication❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We also give names to the objects which have one of these
    additional properties or the other. ⦉

  ‖ A ring which for which multipliation is commutative is
    called a ❬commutative ring❭. ⦉

  ‖ Note that a ring is ‹always› commutative with respect to
    addition, here the term commutative refers to multiplication. ⦉

  ‖ A ring for which there are inverse elements, excepting 0,
    is called a ❬division ring❭). ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Since our guiding example is the set of rationals $𝗤 $
    with addition and multiplication defined in the usual manner,
    and we use a bold font for $𝗤 $, we tend to denote an
    arbitrary field by $𝗙 $, a mnemonic for “field.” ⦉
⦉

§ Field operations ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Along with field addition and field multiplication, we call
    the function which takes an element of a field to its
    additive inverse and the function which takes an element of
    a field to its multiplicative inverse the ❬field operations❭. ⦉
