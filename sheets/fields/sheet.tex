\ssection{Why}

We generalize the algebraic structure of addition and multiplication over the rationals.

\ssection{Definition}

A \ct{field}{ring} is two algebras over
the same ground set with:
(1) both algebras are commutative groups
(2) the operation of the second algebra
distributes over the operation of the first
algebra.

We call the operation of the first algebra
\ct{field addition}{fieldaddition}.
We call the operation of the second algebra
\ct{field multiplication}{fieldaddition}.

\ssubsection{Notation}

We denote an arbitrary field by $\F$, a mnemonic for \say{field.}
