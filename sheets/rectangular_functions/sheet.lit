¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬rectangular function❭ corresponds to a characterstic
    function of an interval. ⦉

  ‖ It represents a rectangle whose width is the interval and
    whose height is one. ⦉

⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A$ be a non-empty set and $B ⊂ A$. ⦉

  ‖ Recall that we denote the characteristic function of $B$ by
    $χ_{B}$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Now suppose that $A ⊂ 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ If we embed $\set{0, 1} = 2 ∈ 𝗡$ in $𝗥$ by associating
    $0$ to $0_{𝗥}$ and $1$ to $1_{𝗥}$ then every characteristic
    function is identified with a function from $𝗥$ to $𝗥$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ In particular, notice that if $B$ is an interval and $α$
    is a real number then $α χ_{B}$ is a rectangle with height
    $α$. ⦉
