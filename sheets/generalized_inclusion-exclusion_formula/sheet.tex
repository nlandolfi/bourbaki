\section*{Why}

If $A$ and $B$ are two events in some finite sample space $\Omega $ and $P$ is the event probability function of some distribution, we have seen that
\[
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap  B)
\]
What if we have three events $A, B, C$?
What of a list of $n$ events $A_1, \dots , A_n$?

\section*{Case of $n = 3$.}

\begin{proposition}
Suppose $A, B, C$ are events in a finite sample space and $P$ is any event probability function.
Then
\[
\begin{aligned}
P(A \cup B \cup C) = P&(A) + P(B) + P(C) \\ &- P(A \cap B) - P(A \cap  C) - P(B \cap  C) \\ &+ P(A \cap  B \cap  C)
\end{aligned}
\]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}Express
\[
\begin{aligned}
P(A \cup B \cup C)
&= P(A \cup B) + P(C) - P((A \cup B) \cap  C) \\
&= P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(A \cap  B) - P((A \cup B) \cap C) \\
\end{aligned}
\]
by using the inclusion-exclusion formula.
Recall\footnote{See \sheetref{set_unions_and_intersections}{Set Unions and Intersections}.}
that
\[
(A \cup B) \cap  C = (A \cap  C) \cup (B \cap  C)
\]
Now use the inclusion-exclusion formula again, and properties of set pair intersections to get
\[
\begin{aligned}
P((A \cup B) \cap  C)
&= P(A \cap  C) + P(B \cap  C) - P((A \cap  C) \cap  (B \cap  C)) \\
&= P(A \cap  C) + P(B \cap  C) - P(A \cap  B \cap  C) \\
\end{aligned}
\]\end{proof}
\section*{Case of $n$.}

\begin{proposition}
Suppose $A_1, \dots , A_n,$ are events in a finite sample space and $P$ is any event probability function.
Then
\[
\begin{aligned}
P(A_1 \cup \cdots \cup A_n) =
\sum P&(A_i) -\sum P(A_i \cap  A_j) \\
&\sum P(A_i \cap  A_j \cap  A_k) - \cdots \\
&(-1)^{n-1} P(A_1 \cap  \cdots A_n)
\end{aligned}
\]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}This can be shown by induction on the number of events $n$.
Future editions will include.\end{proof}
Here there are ${n \choose r}$ terms in the $r$th sum, $r = 1, \dots , n$.
