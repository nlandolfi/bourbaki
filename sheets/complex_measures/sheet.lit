§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We allow measures to take complex values.

    ⦉⦉

  ‖ The follow development is analogous to the real case. ⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A complex-valued function on a sigma algebra is ❬countably
    additive❭ if the result of the function applied to the union
    of a disjoint countable family of distinguished sets is the
    limit of the partial sums of the results of the function
    applied to each of the sets individually. ⦉

  ‖ The limit of the partial sums must exist irregardless of
    the summand order. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬complex measure❭ is an complex-valued function on a sigma
    algebra that is ⦉

  ‖ (1) zero on the empty set and ⦉

  ‖ (2) countably additive. ⦉

  ‖ We call the result of the function applied to a set in
    the sigma algebra the ❬complex measure❭ (or when no ambiguity
    arises, the ❬measure❭) of the set. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Since the codomain of a complex measures is the set of
    complex numbers, the sum corresponding to every countable
    union must be absolutely convergent (?).

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote complex measures by $μ$ a mnemonic for “measure.” ⦉

  ‖ Let $C$ denote the set of complex numbers. ⦉

  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜)$ be a measurable space and let $μ: 𝒜 → C$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $μ$ is a complex measure if
    𝍫 ⦊
      ‣ $μ(∅) = 0$ and ⦉

      ‣ $μ(∪_{i} A_i) = \lim_{n → ∞} ∑_{k = 1}^{n} μ(A_k)$ ⦉

      ‖ for all disjoint families $\seq{A}$. ⦉
