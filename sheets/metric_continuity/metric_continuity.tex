\stitle{Metric Continuity}

\ssection{Why}

We define continuity for
functions between metric
spaces.


\ssection{Definition}

Our inspiration is continuity
of functions from the set of
real numbers to the set of real
numbers. There we decided on
a definition which codified our
intuition that numbers which
are sufficiently close to each
other are mapped to numbers
that are close to each other.

A function from a
first metric space
to a second metric space is
\ct{continuous at}{continuousat}
an object of its domain
if, for every positive real number
(no matter how small), there is
a second positive real number
(possibly, though not necessarily, smaller)
so that every element in the domain
whose distance
to the fixed object is less than the second
positive number has a result under the function
whose distance to the result of the
fixed object is less than the first positive
number.

A function between metric
spaces is continuous if it is
\ct{continuous}{metriccontintuousfunction}
at every object of its domain.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(A, d)$ and $(B, d')$
be metric spaces.
Let $f: (A, d) \to (B, d')$.
Then $f$ is continuous at $\bar{a} \in A$,
if for all real numbers $\epsilon > 0$,
there exists a real number $\delta > 0$
such that for all $a \in A$,
\[
  d(\bar{a}, a) < \delta \implies d'(f(\bar{a}), f(a)) < \epsilon.
\]
