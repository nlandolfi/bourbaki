\section*{Why}

As with introducing \sheetref{equivalent_sets}{Equivalent Sets}, we want to talk about the size of a set.\footnote{Will be expanded in future editions.}

\section*{Definition}

A \t{finite} set is one that is equivalent to some natural number; an infinite set is one which is not finite.
From this we can show that $\omega $ is infinite.
This justifies the language ``principle of infinity'' with \sheetref{natural_numbers}{Natural Numbers}.
The principle of infinity asserts the existence of a particular infinite set; namely $\omega $.

\section*{Motivation for set number}

It happens that if a set is equivalent to a natural number, it is equivalent to only one natural number.

\begin{proposition}
A set can be equivalent to at most one natural number.\footnote{Future edition will include proof, which uses comparability of numbers and the results of \sheetref{equivalent_sets}{Equivalent Sets}.}
\end{proposition}

A consequence is that a finite set is never equivalent to a proper subset of itself.
So long as we are considering finite sets, a piece (subset) is always less than than the whole (original set).

\begin{proposition}
A finite set is never equivalent to a proper subset of itself.
\end{proposition}

\section*{Subsets of finite sets}

Every subset of a natural number is equivalent to a natural number.\footnote{This requires proof, and may become a proposition in future editions.}
A consequence is:

\begin{proposition}
Every subset of a finite set is finite.\footnote{An account will appear in future editions.}
\end{proposition}

\section*{Unions of finite sets}

\begin{proposition}
If $A$ and $B$ are finite, then $A \union B$ is finite.
\end{proposition}

\section*{Products of finite sets}

\begin{proposition}
If $A$ and $B$ are finite, then $A \times B$ is finite.
\end{proposition}

\section*{Powers of finite sets}

\begin{proposition}
If $A$ is finite then $\powerset{A}$ is finite.
\end{proposition}

\section*{Functions between finite sets}

\begin{proposition}
If $A$ and $B$ are finite, then $A^B$ is finite.
\end{proposition}
