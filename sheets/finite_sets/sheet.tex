\ssection{Why}

\ssection{Definition}

We want to talk about the size of a set.
A \t{finite} set is one that is equivalent to some natural number; an infinite set is one which is not finite.

\begin{prop}
A set can be equivalent to at most one natural number.
\end{prop}

The \t{number} of a finite set is the unique natural number equivalent to it.
We also call this the \t{size} of the set.

\ssubsection{Notation}

We denote the number of a set by $\num{A}$.

\ssection{Properties}

\begin{prop}
$A \subset B \implies \num{a} \leq \num{B}$
\end{prop}

% \begin{prop}
%   $A \intersect B = \emptyset \implies \num{A \union B} = \num{A} + \num{B}$.
% \end{prop}
