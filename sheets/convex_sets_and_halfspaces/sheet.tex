\ssection{Why}

\ssection{Main Result}

\begin{corr}
  Let $\parens*{b_i}_{i \in I}$ be a family in $\R^n$ and $\parens*{\beta_i}_{i \in I}$ be a family in $\R$. The set
$$
  \Set*{x \in \R^n}{\ip{x}{b_i} \leq \beta_i \text{ for all } i \in I}
$$
is convex.
\end{corr}

A \t{polyhedral} convex set is one which can be expressed as the intersection of a finite family of closed halfspaces.
