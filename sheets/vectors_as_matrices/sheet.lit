  ‖ Vectors can be identified with matrices of width 1. ⦉

  ‖ \ssection{Canonical Identification} ⦉

  ‖ We identify $𝗥^{n}$ with $𝗥^{n × 1}$ in the obvious way. ⦉

  ‖ For this reason, we call $x ∈ 𝗥^{n × 1}$ (meaning $x ∈
    𝗥^{n}$) a ❬column vector❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ For the reasons that we identify $𝗥^n$ with $𝗥^{n × 1}$,
    we write the vector $a = (a_1, a_2, a_3) ∈ 𝗥^3$ as

⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We could as easily also identify $𝗥^{n}$ with $𝗥^{1 × n}$. ⦉

  ‖ We avoid this convention. ⦉

  ‖ However, by analogy with the language “column vector,” we
    refer to the ‹matrix› $y ∈ 𝗥^{1 × n}$ as a ❬row vector❭. ⦉

  ‖ \ssection{Matrix transpose} ⦉

  ‖ We frequently move from $𝗥^{n × 1}$ and $𝗥^{1 × n}$. ⦉

  ‖ If $a ∈ 𝗥^{n × 1}$, we denote $b ∈ 𝗥^{1 × n}$ defined
    by $b_i = a_i$ by $a^\tp$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ More generally, given a matrix $A ∈ 𝗥^{m \times n}$, we
    denote the matrix $B ∈ 𝗥^{m × n}$ defined by $B_{ij} =
    A_{ji}$ by $A^\tp$. ⦉

  ‖ Notice that the entries of $i$ and $j$ have swapped. ⦉

  ‖ We call the matrix $B$ the ❬transpose❭ of $A$, and so call
    $a^\tp$ the ❬transpose❭ fo the vector $a$. ⦉

  ‖ Clearly, $(A^\tp)^\tp = A$ and $(a^\tp)^\tp$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ \ssubsection{Reals as vectors} ⦉

  ‖ There is a similar, and similarly obvious, identification of
    scalars $a ∈ \R$ with the 1-vectors $𝗥^{1}$ (and so with
    the 1 by 1 matrices $𝗥^{1 × 1}$). ⦉

  ‖ Given our definition of matrix-vector products, if identify
    $a ∈ 𝗥$ with $A ∈ \R^{1 × 1}$ where $A_{11} = a$, then
    $Ax = ax$. ⦉

  ‖ \ssection{Familiar concepts, new notation} ⦉

  ‖ These identifications and the notation of transposition give
    allow us to write several familiar concepts in a compact
    notation. ⦉

  ‖ We write the norm $\norm{x}$ as
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \norm{x} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + ⋯ + x_n^2} =
        \sqrt{x^\tp x}. ⦉

  ‖ We express the symmetry of the inner product by $ x^\tp y
    = y^\tp x$. ⦉
