  ‖ A vector can be viewed as a matrix of height 1 or a
    matrix of width one. ⦉

  ‖ \ssection{Canonical Identification} ⦉

  ‖ We identify $𝗥^{n}$ with $𝗥^{n × 1}$ in the obvious way. ⦉

  ‖ For this reason, we call $x ∈ 𝗥^{n}$ (equivalently $x ∈
    𝗥^{n × 1}$) a ❬column vector❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We write the vector ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We could as easily also identify $𝗥^{n}$ with $𝗥^{1 × n}$. ⦉

  ‖ We avoid this convention. ⦉

  ‖ However, by analogy with the language “column vector,” we
    refer to the ‹matrix› $y ∈ 𝗥^{1 × n}$ as a ❬row vector❭. ⦉
