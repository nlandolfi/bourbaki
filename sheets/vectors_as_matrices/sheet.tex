\ssection{Why}
A vector can be viewed as a matrix of height 1 or a matrix of width one.

\ssection{Canonical Identification}
We identify $\R^{n}$ with $\R^{n \times 1}$ in the obvious way.
For this reason, we call $x \in \R^{n}$ (equivalently $x \in \R^{n \times 1}$) a \t{column vector}.

We write the vector

We could as easily also identify $\R^{n}$ with $\R^{1 \times n}$.
We avoid this convention.
However, by analogy with the language \say{column vector,} we refer to the \textit{matrix} $y \in \R^{1 \times n}$ as a \t{row vector}.
