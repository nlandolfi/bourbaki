§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬variance❭ of a square-integrable real-valued random
    variable is the expectation of its square less its
    expectation squared. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $f: X → 𝗥$ is a random variable on a probability
    space $(X, 𝒜, P)$. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the variance of $f$ by $\var f$, so that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \var f L= 𝗘(f^2) - (𝗘(f))^2. ⦉

§ Results ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ If a random variable on a probability space is square
    integrable then it is integrable. ⦉
  <proof>
    ‖ The $L^p$ spaces are nested ⦉

    ‖ for finite measures. ⦉
  </proof>
</statement>
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ The variance of a square-integrable real-valued random
    variable is the expectation of the square of the difference
    between the random variable and its expectation. ⦉
