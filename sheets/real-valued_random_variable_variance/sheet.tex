\section*{Definition}

The \t{variance} of a square-integrable real-valued random variable is the expectation of its square less its expectation squared.

\subsection*{Notation}

Suppose $f: X \to \R $ is a random variable on a probability space $(X, \mathcal{A} , P)$.
We denote the variance of $f$ by $\var f$, so that
\[
\var f L= \E (f^2) - (\E (f))^2.
\]

\section*{Results}

\begin{proposition}
If a random variable on a probability space is square integrable then it is integrable.
\begin{proof}The $L^p$ spaces are nested
for finite measures.\end{proof}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
The variance of a square-integrable real-valued random variable is the expectation of the square of the difference between the random variable and its expectation.
\end{proposition}
