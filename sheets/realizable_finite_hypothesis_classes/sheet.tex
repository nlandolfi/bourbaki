\ssection{Why}

What if we restrict our hypothesis class to have finite size?\footnote{Future editions are likely to change the name of this sheet. Future editions will also discuss that this assumption is (in a sense) \say{mild,} and may include reference to discretization or floating point arithmetic.}

\ssection{Definition}

Let $\CD = (\Omega, \CA, \mathbfsf{Q})$ be a probability space.
Let $x_i: \Omega \to \CX$ be independent and identically distributed for $i = 1, \dots, n$.
Let $f: \CX \to \CY$ and define $y_i: \Omega \to \CY$ by $y_i = f(x_i)$.
Define $S: \Omega \to (\CX \times \CY)^n$ by $S(\omega) = ((x_1(\omega), y_1(\omega)), \dots, (x_n(\omega), y_n(\omega)))$.
Define the product space $(\Omega^n, \CA^n, \PM)$.\footnote{Future editions will expand.}

Let $\CH \subset (\CX \to \CY)$ with $\num{\CH} = m$.

There is a low probability to obtain a \say{nonrepresentative} dataset.
This dataset may lead to selecting a hypothesis with low empirical
