  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ The integral ⦉

    ‖ of the limit inferior ⦉

    ‖ of a sequence ⦉

    ‖ of measurable, nonnegative, ⦉

    ‖ extended-real-valued ⦉

    ‖ functions is ⦉

    ‖ no larger than ⦉

    ‖ the limit inferior ⦉

    ¶ ⦊
      ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ be a measure space, and let $\seqt{f}:
        → \nneri$ a $𝒜$-measurable function for every natural
        number $n$. ⦉

      ‖ We want to show that if
