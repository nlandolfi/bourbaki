\begin{proposition}
The integral
of the limit inferior
of a sequence
of measurable, nonnegative,
extended-real-valued
functions is
no larger than
the limit inferior
of the sequence
of integrals.

\begin{proof}Let $(X, \mathcal{A} , \mu )$ be a measure space, and let $\seqt{f}: \to \nneri$ a $\mathcal{A} $-measurable function for every natural number $n$.
We want to show that if
\[
\int \liminf_n f_n d\mu  \leq \liminf_n \int f_n d\mu .
\]
\end{proof}
\end{proposition}
