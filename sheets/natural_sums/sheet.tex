\ssection{Why}

We want to combine two groups.\footnote{Future editions will change this section.}

\ssection{Definition}

Let $m$ and $n$ be two natural numbers.\footnote{Future editions will explicitly use the recursion theorem.}
If we apply the successor function to $m$ $n$
times we obtain a number.
If we apply the successor function to $n$ $m$
times we obtain a number.
Indeed, we obtain the same number in both cases.
We call this number the \t{sum}
of $m$ and $n$.
We say we \t{add} $m$ to $n$,
or vice versa.
We call this correspondence, between
$(m, n)$ and the sum, \t{addition}.

\ssubsection{Notation}

We denote the sum of two numbers by $m + n$.
% We denote the function addition by $+$
% and so denote the sum of the naturals
% $m$ and $n$ by $m + n$.
