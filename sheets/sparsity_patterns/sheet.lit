§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Certain sparse matrices are easier to work with, especially
    those with chordal sparsity patterns.

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬sparsity pattern❭ $E$ of ❬order❭ $n$ is a set of
    (unordered) pairs of $V = \set{1, …, n}$. ⦉

  ‖ A sparsity pattern is ❬chordal❭ if the undirected graph $(V,
    E)$ is chordal. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A symmetric matrix is said to ❬have a sparsity pattern❭ if
    its $ij$th entry is zero whenever $\set{i, j}$ is not in
    the sparsity pattern. The diagonal entries and off-diagonal
    entries for pairs appearing in the sparsity pattern may or
    may not be zero. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The graph whose vertices are one through $n$ and whose edge
    set is the sparsity patter is called the ❬sparsity graph❭ ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A sparsity pattern is not a property of a matrix because
    it is not unique (unless all off-diagonal entries are
    non-zero). If a matrix has a particular sparsity pattern it
    has every sparsity pattern which is a superset of it. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, every matrix has the sparsity pattern which
    is the set of all pairs of integers. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $E ⊂ \Set*{\set{i, j}}{i, j ∈ \set{1, 2, …, n}}$. ⦉

  ‖ A symmetric matrix $A ∈ 𝗦^n$ is said to have sparsity
    pattern $E$ if $A_{ij} = A_{ji} = 0$ wheneer $i ≠ j$ and
    $\set{i, j} ∉ E$. ⦉

  ‖ The graph $G = (V, E)$ where $V = \set{1, 2, …, n}$ is
    the sparsity graph associated with $E$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We will denote the symmetric matrices of order $n$ with
    sparsity pattern $E$ by $𝗦^n_{E}$. ⦉
