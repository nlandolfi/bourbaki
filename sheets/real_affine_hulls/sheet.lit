§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬affine hull❭ of a set in $n$-dimensional space is the
    intersection of the collection of affine sets which contain
    it. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the affine hull of $S$ by $\aff S$. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ The affine hull of $S ⊂ 𝗥^n$ consists of all vectors which
    can be expressed as
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ λ_1 x_1 + λ_2 x_2 ⋯ + λ_m x_m ⦉
    ⦉
    such that $x_i ∈ S$ and $∑_i λ_i = 1$. ⦉
</statement>
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Also, notice that if $A ⊂ 𝗥^n$ is affine, then $\aff A =
    A$. ⦉
