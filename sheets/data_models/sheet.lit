§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A distribution/density selector picks a probabilistic model
    for a dataset by using the maximum likelihood principle. ⦉

  ‖ We want to generalize this idea.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions probably include a genetic approach, which
        moves through clustering and mixtures of Gaussians to
        illustrate the point more fully. ⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ An ❬unsupervised data model❭ is a function $ℓ: 𝗥^d → 𝗥$
    where $ℓ(x)$ is the ❬suprise❭ of the vector $x$.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will expand. ⦉
