  ‖ \ssection{Why} ⦉

  ‖ A distribution/density selector picks a probabilistic model
    for a dataset by using the maximum likelihood principle. ⦉

  ‖ We want to generalize this idea.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions probably include a genetic approach, which
        moves through clustering and mixtures of Gaussians to
        illustrate the point more fully. ⦉
