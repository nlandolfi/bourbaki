\section*{Why}

A distribution/density selector picks a probabilistic model for a dataset by using the maximum likelihood principle.
We want to generalize this idea.\footnote{Future editions probably include a genetic approach, which moves through clustering and mixtures of Gaussians to illustrate the point more fully.}

\section*{Definition}

An \t{unsupervised data model} is a function $\ell : \R ^d \to \R $ where $\ell (x)$ is the \t{suprise} of the vector $x$.\footnote{Future editions will expand.}
