\ssection{Why}
A distribution/density selector picks a probabilistic model for a dataset by using the maximum likelihood principle.
We want to generalize this idea.

Future editions probably include a genetic approach, which moves through clustering and mixtures of Gaussians to illustrate the point more fully.

\section{Definition}

An \t{unsupervised data model} is a function $\ell : \R ^d \to \R $ where $\ell (x)$ is the \t{suprise} of the vector $x$.
