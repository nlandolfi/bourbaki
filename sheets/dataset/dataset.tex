\stitle{Dataset}

\ssection{Why}

We want language to talk about
a list of elements from a set.

\ssection{Definition}

A \ct{dataset}{} is a finite
sequence of elements from a set.
We say that the data set is
\ct{in}{}
the set.
We refer to the length of
the sequence as the
\ct{size}{} of the data set
and we refer to an element
of the sequence as a \ct{record}{}
of the data set.

\subsection{Notation}

Let $A$ be a non-empty set.
We usually denote sequences
by $(a_1, \dots, a_n)$,
 but for data sets we will
 use a superscript,
$(a^1, \dots, a^n)$.
Often $A$ is itself
a set of sequences,
and we will want to refer
to the $i$th component of
$a^1$ by $a^1_i$.
