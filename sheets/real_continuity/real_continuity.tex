\stitle{Real Continuity}

\ssection{Why}

We try to precisely
characterize the idea
that a function is
continuous, or uninterrupted.

\ssection{Definition}

Consider a function from the real
numbers to the real numbers.

The function
is \ct{continuous at a point}{}
in its domain if for every positive
real number, there is a positive real
number such that every pointin the domain
which is the second positive number close
to the first element has result which is
the first positive number close to the second.

A function is \ct{continuous}{} if it
is continuous at every point of its domain.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $R$ denote the set of real numbers.
Let $f: R \to R$.
Then $f$ is continuous at $x \in R$ if
\[
  (\forall \epsilon > 0)(\exists \delta > 0)(\abs{x - y} < \delta \implies \abs{f(x) - f(y)} < \epsilon)
\]
for all $y \in R$.

Then $f$ is continuous.
\[
  (\forall x \in R)(\forall \epsilon > 0)(\exists \delta > 0)(\abs{x - y} < \delta \implies \abs{f(x) - f(y)} < \epsilon)
\]
for all $y \in R$.
