§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ What does it mean for a function to continuous, or
    uninterrupted. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Consider a function from the real numbers to the real
    numbers. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The function is ❬continuous at a point❭ in its domain if
    for every positive real number, there is a positive real
    number such that every pointin the domain which is the
    second positive number close to the first element has result
    which is the first positive number close to the second. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A function is ❬continuous❭ if it is continuous at every
    point of its domain. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $f: 𝗥 → 𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $f$ is continuous at $x ∈ 𝗥$ if
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ (∀ ϵ > 0)(∃δ > 0)(\abs{x - y} < δ ⟹ \abs{f(x) -
        f(y)} < ϵ) ⦉
    ⦉
    for all $y ∈ 𝗥$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Then $f$ is continuous.
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ (∀ x ∈ R)(∀ ϵ > 0)(∃δ > 0)(\abs{x - y} < δ ⟹
        \abs{f(x) - f(y)} < ϵ) ⦉
    ⦉
    for all $y ∈ 𝗥$. ⦉
