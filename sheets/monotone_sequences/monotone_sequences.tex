\stitle{Monotone Sequences}

\ssection{Why}

If the base set of a
sequence has a partial
order, then we can
discuss its relation
to the order
of sequence.

\ssection{Definition}

A sequence on a partially
ordered set is
\ct{non-decreasing}{}
if whenever
a first index precedes
a second index the element
associated with the
first index precedes
the element associated with
the second element.
A sequence on a partially
ordered set is
\ct{increasing}{}
if it is non-decreasing and
no two elements are the same.

A sequence on a partially
ordered set is
\ct{non-increasing}{}
if whenever
a first index precedes
a second index the element
associated with the
first index succedes
the element associated with
the second element.
A sequence on a partially
ordered set is
\ct{decreasing}{}
if it is non-increasing and
no two elements are the same.

A sequence on a partially
ordered set is
\ct{monotone}{}
if it is non-decreasing,
or non-increasing.
An increasing sequence is
non-decreasing.
A decreasing sequences is
non-increasing.
A sequence on a partially
ordered set is
\ct{strictly monotone}{}
if it is decreasing,
or increasing.

\ssubsection{Notation}


Let $A$ a non-empty set with
partial order $\preceq$.
Let $\seq{a}$ a sequence in $A$.

The sequence is
non-decreasing if
$n \leq m \implies a_n \preceq a_m$,
and increasing if
$n < m \implies a_n \prec a_m$.
The sequence is
non-increasing if
$n \leq m \implies a_n \succeq a_m$,
and decreasing if
$n < m \implies a_n > a_m$.

\ssection{Examples}

\begin{expl}
  Let $A$ a non-empty set
  and $\seq{A}$ a sequence of
  sets in $\powerset{A}$.
  Partially order elements
  of $\powerset{A}$ by
  the relation contained in.
