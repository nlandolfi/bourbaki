\ssection{Why}

We want to handle sets of outcomes at once.

\ssection{Definition}

Consider a set of outcomes.
An \t{event} with respect to this set of outcomes is a subset of the set of outcomes.
The set of outcomes is finite, so the set of events is finite as well.
Namely, it is the power set of the set of outcomes.
