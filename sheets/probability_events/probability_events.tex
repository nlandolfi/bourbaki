\ssection{Why}

We want to handle sets of outcomes
at once.

\ssection{Definition}

Consider a set of outcomes.
An \ct{event}{} with respect
to this set of outcomes is a
subset of the set of outcomes.
The set of outcomes is finite,
so the set of events is
finite as well. Namely, it
is the power set of the set
of outcomes.
