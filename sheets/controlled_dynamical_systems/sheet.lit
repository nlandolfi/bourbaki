§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to talk about influencing natural phenomena.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will modify, and may restore former
        editions language: “We want to talk about making decisions
        over time.” ⦉

      ‖ Though this language may also be used in a sheet on
        ‹finite› controlled dynamical systems. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $𝒳_0, 𝒳_1, …, 𝒳_{T}$ and $𝒰_0, 𝒰_1, …, 𝒰_{T-1}$ be
    sets. ⦉

  ‖ For $t = 0$, $…$, $T-1$, let $f_{t}: 𝒳_t × 𝒰_t → 𝒳_{t+1}$. ⦉

  ‖ We call the triple
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ ((𝒳_t)_{t = 0}^{T}), (𝒰_t)_{t=0}^{T-1}, (f_t)_{t=1}^{T-1}) ⦉
    ⦉
    a ❬controlled deterministic discrete-time dynamical system❭. ⦉

  ‖ We call the index $t$ the ❬epoch❭ (or ❬stage❭, ❬period❭). ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $x_0 ∈ 𝒳_0$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $u_0 ∈ 𝒰_0, …, u_{T-1} ∈ 𝒰_{T-1}$. Define a state
    sequence $x_1 ∈ 𝒳_1, …, x_T ∈ 𝒳_T$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ x_{t+1} = f_t(x_t, u_t). ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ In this case we call $x_0$ the ❬initial state❭. ⦉

  ‖ We call the $x_t$ the ❬states❭. ⦉

  ‖ We call the $u_t$ a sequence of ❬inputs❭ (or ❬actions❭,
    ❬decisions❭, ❬choices❭, or ❬controls❭). ⦉

  ‖ We call $f_t$ the ❬transition function❭ (or ❬dynamics
    function❭). ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We call $T$ the ❬horizon❭. ⦉

  ‖ In the case that we have an infinite sequence of state
    sets, input sets, and dynamics, then we refer to a
    ❬infinite-horizon❭ dynamical system. ⦉

  ‖ To use language in contrast with this case, we refer to
    the dynamical system when $T$ is finite as a ❬finite-horizon❭
    dynamical system. ⦉
⦉

§§ State ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The current action $u_t$ affects future states $x_{s}$ for
    $s > t$, but not the current or past states. ⦉

  ‖ The current state $x_t$ depends on the initial state $x_0$
    and the sequence of past actions $u_0, …, u_{t-1}$. ⦉

  ‖ So the state is a “link” between the past and the future. ⦉

  ‖ Given $x_t$ and $u_t, …, u_{s-1}$, for $s > t$, we can
    compute $x_s$. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, the prior actions $u_0, …, u_{t-1}$ are not
    relevant. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ This nonrelevancy of prior actions and prior states
    simplifies the sequential decision problem (see␣
    <a href='/sheets/sequential_decisions.html'>
      ‖ Sequential Decisions ⦉
    </a>
    ). ⦉
⦉

§§ Variations ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The dynamical system is called ❬time-invariant❭ if $𝒳_{t}$,
    $𝒰_t$ and $f_t$ do not depend on $t$. ⦉

  ‖ A simple variation is that $𝒰_t$ depends on $x_t$.

§ Examples ⦉

§§ Finite dynamical system ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A dynamical system is finite if the state and action sets
    are finite. ⦉

  ‖ For example, $𝒳 = \set{1, …, n}$ and $𝒰 = \set{1, …, m}$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $f_t: 𝒳 × 𝒰 → 𝒰$ is called a ❬transition map❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Or else, let $(V, E)$ be a directed graph, then $𝒳 = V$,
    $𝒰_{x_t} = \Set{(u, v) ∈ E}{u = x_t}$ and $f_t(x_t, u_t) =
    v$ when $u_t = (x_t, v)$ is a dynamical system. ⦉

  ‖ Roughly this system models “moving” on the graph. ⦉
⦉

§§ Discrete-time linear dynamical system ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $𝒳 = 𝗥^n$ and $𝒰 = 𝗥^m$. ⦉

  ‖ Define $f_t: 𝒳 × 𝒰 → 𝒳$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ x_{t+1} = f_t(x_t, u_t) = A_t x_t + B_t u_t + c_t ⦉
    ⦉
    for $y = 1, …, T-1$.
    † ⦊
      ‖ This very special form of dynamics arises in many
        applications. Future editions will say more. ⦉
