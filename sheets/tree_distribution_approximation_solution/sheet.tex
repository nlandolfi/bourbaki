\ssection{Why}

We can characterize the solutions of tree-distribution approximation.

\ssection{Solution}

\begin{prop}

  Let $q$ be a distribution on $A$. Let $T$ be
  a tree on $\set{1, \dots, d}$. Let $p_j$ be
  the parent of vertex $j$ for the $T$ rooted
  at vertex $i$, $j = 1,\dots,n$ and $j \neq i$.
  Then the distribution $p$ on $A$ defined by
  \[
    p = q_i \prod_{j \neq i} q_{j \mid p_j}
  \]
  achieves minimum entropy relative to $q$ among
  all distributions which factor according to $T$.

\end{prop}

\begin{prop}

Let $q$ be a distribution on $A$.
A tree $T$ is a solution to the problem above if and only if it is a maximal spanning tree of the mutual information graph of $q$.

\end{prop}
