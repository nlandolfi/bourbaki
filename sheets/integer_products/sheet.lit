¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want sums to follow those of natural numbers.

⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Consider $\eqc{(a, b)}, \eqc{(b, c)} ∈ 𝗭$. ⦉

  ‖ We define ❬integer product❭ of $\eqc{(a, b)}$ with $\eqc{(b,
    c)}$ as $\eqc{(ac + bd, ad + bc)}$.
    † ⦊
      ‖ One needs to show that this is well-defined. The account
        will appear in future editions. ⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ \ssubsection{Notation} ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the product of $\eqc{(a, b)}$ and $\eqc{(c, d)}$
    by $\eqc{(a, b)} · \eqc{(b, c)}$ ⦉

  ‖ So if $x, y ∈ 𝗭$ then the sum of $x$ and $y$ is $x·y$. ⦉

  ‖ As with natural products, we often drop the $·$ and write
    $xy$ for $x·y$. ⦉
