\ssection{Why}
We want to summarize a dataset with a distribution.

\ssection{Overview}

Given a finite set $\CU$, the \t{likelihood} (or \t{distribution likelihood}) of a distribution $p: \CU \to \R$ on a dataset $u^1, \dots, u^n \in \CU$ is $\prod_{i = 1}^{n} p(u^i)$
A \t{maximum likelihood distribution} $p^\star: \CU \to \R$ is one which maximizes the likelihood over all distributions on $\CU$.

We call the correspondence between datasets and distributions the \t{maximum likelihood algorithm}.
We say that we are selecting the distribution according to the \t{maximum likelihood principle}.
In general, we call any function from datasets to distributions a \t{distribution selector}.
