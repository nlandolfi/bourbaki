\ssection{Why}
We want to summarize a dataset with a probability distribution.

\ssection{Overview}

Let $u^1, \dots, u^n$ be a dataset in $\CU$.
We want a correspondence between the dataset and probability distributions over the set of outcomes $A$.

The \t{likelihood} of the dataset $u^1, \dots, u^n$ is $\prod_{i = 1}^{n} p(u^i)$.
A \t{maximum likelihood distribution} $p^\star: \CU \to \R$ is one which maximizes the likelihood over all distributions on $\CU$.

We call the correspondence between datasets and distributions the \t{maximum likelihood algorithm}.
We say that we are selecting the distribution according to the \t{maximum likelihood principle}.
In general, we call any function from datasets to to distributions a \t{distribution selector}.
