\ssection{Why}
We want to summarize a dataset with a distribution.

\ssection{Overview}

The \t{likelihood} (or \t{distribution likelihood}) of a probability distribution $p: A \to \R $ on a dataset $a^1, \dots , a^n \in A$ is $\prod_{i = 1}^{n} p(a^i)$.
A \t{maximum likelihood distribution} $p^\star: A \to \R $ is one which maximizes the likelihood over all distributions on $A$.

We call the correspondence between datasets and distributions the \t{maximum likelihood algorithm}.
We say that we are selecting the distribution according to the \t{maximum likelihood principle}.
In general, we call any function from datasets to distributions a \t{distribution selector}.
