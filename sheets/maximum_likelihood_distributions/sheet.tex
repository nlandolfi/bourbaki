\ssection{Why}

We provide a principle for distribution selection based on maximizing the probability of the dataset.

\ssection{Definition}

We have a set of outcomes $A$ and
a dataset $(a^1, \dots, a^n)$.
We want a distribution $p: A \to \R$.
We define $\bar{p}: A^n \to \R$ by
$\bar{p}(a^1, \dots, a^n) = \prod_{i = 1}^{n} p(a^i)$.

The \t{principle of maximum likelihood} says to solve:
\[
  \maximization{p, \text{ a distribution }}{\bar{p}(a^1, \dots, a^n)}
\]
