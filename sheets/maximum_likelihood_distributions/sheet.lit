§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to summarize a dataset with a distribution. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬likelihood❭ (or ❬distribution likelihood❭) of a
    probability distribution $p: A → 𝗥$ on a dataset $a^1, …,
    a^n ∈ A$ is $∏_{i = 1}^{n} p(a^i)$. ⦉

  ‖ A ❬maximum likelihood distribution❭ $p^★: A → 𝗥$ is one
    which maximizes the likelihood over all distributions on $A$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We call the correspondence between datasets and distributions
    the ❬maximum likelihood algorithm❭. ⦉

  ‖ We say that we are selecting the distribution according to
    the ❬maximum likelihood principle❭. ⦉

  ‖ In general, we call any function from datasets to
    distributions a ❬distribution selector❭. ⦉
