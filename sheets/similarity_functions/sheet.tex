\section*{Why}

We want to quantify the similarity of two elements of a set.
In other words, we want a function which associates two objects of a set with a real number quantifying how similar they are.
Our intuition comes from distance functions.

\section*{Definition}

A \t{similarity function} is a function on a cross product of a set with itself that is zero on all ordered pairs whose first and second coordinates are the same.
Notice that a similarity function can associate zero with ordered pairs of different elements also.
That is, on pairs of non-identical elements.
However, this value must be nonnegative.
The similarity function may or may not be symmetric.
