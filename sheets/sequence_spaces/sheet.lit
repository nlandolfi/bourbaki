§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We can view the set of sequences as vector spaces and give
    them norms. ⦉
⦉

§ Bounded sequences ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $𝗖^𝗡$ denote the set of complex-valued sequences. ⦉

  ‖ Define $ℓ^{∈fty} ⊂ \C^{𝗡}$ to be the set of all ❬bounded
    sequences❭. ⦉

  ‖ That is,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ ℓ^{∞} = \Set*{x ∈ \C^{𝗡}}{∃ M ∈ 𝗥 \text{ with }
        \abs{x_i} < M \text{ for all } i}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Then $ℓ^∞$ with componentwise addition and scalar
    multiplication is a vector space. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='exercise'>
  ‖ Define $\norm{\cdot}_{∞}: ℓ^{∞} → 𝗥$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \norm{x}_{∞} = \sup_{n ∈ 𝗡} \abs{x_n}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Then $\norm{\cdot}_{∞}$ is a norm on $ℓ^∞$. ⦉
</statement>

§ Absolutely summable sequences ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $ℓ^1 ⊂ 𝗖^𝗡$ denote the set of all ❬absolutely summable
    sequences❭. In other words, for $x ∈ 𝗖^{𝗡}$, $x ∈ ℓ^1$ if
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ ∑_{n = 1}^{∞} \abs{x_n} < ∞. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Then $ℓ^1$ is a vector space with componentwise addition and
    scalar multiplication. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='exercise'>
  ‖ Define $\norm{\cdot}_{1}: ℓ^{1} → 𝗥$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \norm{x}_{1} = ∑_{n = 1}^{∞} \abs{x_n} ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Then $\norm{\cdot}_{1}$ is a norm on $ℓ^1$. ⦉
