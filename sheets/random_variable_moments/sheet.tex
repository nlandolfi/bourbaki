\ssection{Why}\footnote{Future editions will include.}

\ssection{Results}

If the integral of the $n$th power of a real-valued random variable exists, the \t{$n$th moment} of the random variable is the expectation of its $n$th power.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $(X, \SA, \PM)$ be a probability space.
Let $x$ be a real-valued random variable on $X$ such that $\int x^n d\PM$ exists.
The $n$th moment of $f$ is $\Expect(f^n)$.
