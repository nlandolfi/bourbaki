\ssection{Why}

\ssection{Results}

Let $n$ be a natural
number.
If the integral
of the $n$th power
of a real-valued
random variable exists,
the \ct{$n$th moment}{} of
the random variable
is the expectation
of its $n$th power.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $n$ be a natural number.
Let $(X, \SA, \mu)$ be a
probability space.
Let $f$ be a real-valued
random variable on $X$ such that
$\int f^n d\mu$ exists.
In expectation notation,
the $n$th
moment of $f$ is
$\Expect(f^n)$.
