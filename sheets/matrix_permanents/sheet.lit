§ Why ⦉
† ⦊
  ‖ Future editions will include. The reasoning is that several
    counting problems to do with graphs reduce to permanents of
    the adjacency matrix. ⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬permanent❭ of a matrix $A ∈ 𝗥^{n ×m}$ is
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ ∑_{σ ∈ S_n} ∏_{i = 1}^{n} A_{i, σ(i)} ⦉
    ⦉

    ‖ where $S_n$ is the symmetric group of degree $n$ (see␣

        ‖ Permutations ⦉
      </a>
      ). ⦉⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the permanent of $A$ by $\perm(A)$. ⦉
