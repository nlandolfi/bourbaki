\section*{Why}
\footnote{Future editions will include. The reasoning is that several counting problems to do with graphs reduce to permanents of the adjacency matrix.}
\section*{Definition}

The \t{permanent} of a matrix $A \in \R ^{n \times m}$ is
\[
\sum_{\sigma  \in S_n} \prod_{i = 1}^{n} A_{i, \sigma (i)}
\]
where $S_n$ is the symmetric group of degree $n$ (see \sheetref{permutations}{Permutations}).

\subsection*{Notation}

We denote the permanent of $A$ by $\perm(A)$.
