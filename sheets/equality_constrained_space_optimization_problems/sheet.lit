§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ An optimization problem $(X, f)$ is an ❬equality constrained
    space optimization problem❭ if $X ⊂ 𝗥^n$, $f: 𝗥^n → 𝗥$, and
    there exists $h: 𝗥^n → 𝗥^m$ so that

    ⦉⦉

  ‖ For this reason, $(f, h)$ is sometimes called the ❬problem
    data❭ (❬abstract problem data❭) of the problem. ⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We often write such problems as: given $f: 𝗥^n → 𝗥$ and
    $h: 𝗥^n → 𝗥^m$, find $x ∈ 𝗥^n$ to
