\ssection{Definition}

Two events are \ct{independent}{}
if the probability of
their intersection is
the product of their respective
probabilities.

\ssection{Definition}

Let $\PE$ be an
event probability function
with set of outcomes $A$.
Then the events $B$ and $C$
are independent if
\[
  \PE(B \intersect C) = \PE(B)\PE(C).
\]
