§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬standard deviation❭ of a real-valued random variable is
    the square root of its variance. ⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $f$ be an integrable real-valued random variable. ⦉

  ‖ Denote the standard deviation of $f$ by $\std(f)$. ⦉

  ‖ We have defined it
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \std(f) = √{\var(f)}. ⦉
