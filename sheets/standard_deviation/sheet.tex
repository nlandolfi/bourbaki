\footnote{Future editions will include this.}

\ssection{Definition}

The \t{standard deviation} of a real-valued random variable is the square root of its variance.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $f$ be an
integrable real-valued
random variable.
Denote the
standard deviation
of $f$ by
$\std(f)$.
We have defined it
\[
  \std(f) = \sqrt{\var(f)}.
\]
