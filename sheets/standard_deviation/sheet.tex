\ssection{Definition}

The
\ct{standard deviation}{}
of an integrable
real-valued random
variable is the
square root of
its variance.


\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $f$ be an
integrable real-valued
random variable.
Denote the
standard deviation
of $f$ by
$\std(f)$.
We have defined it
\[
  \std(f) = \sqrt{\var(f)}.
\]
