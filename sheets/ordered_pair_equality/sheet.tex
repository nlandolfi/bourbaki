\ssection{Why}

To agree with our inuition, an if two ordered pairs are the same, they shoulld have the same objects in the same place.
And conversely, if they have the same objects in the same place, they should be the same.

\ssection{Result}

We can prove that our definition of an ordered pair (as a set, see \sheetref{ordered_pairs}{Ordered Pairs}) agrees with this intuition.
In other words,

\begin{proposition}
  $(a, b) = (c, d)$ if and only if $a = b$ and $c = d$.
\end{proposition}
