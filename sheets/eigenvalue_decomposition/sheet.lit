§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We discuss a decomposition using eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

§ Defining result ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ An ❬eigenvalue decomposition❭ of a matrix $A ∈ 𝗥^{n ×n}$ is
    an ordered pair $(X, Λ)$ in which $X$ is invertible, $Λ$ is
    diagonal, and $A = XΛX^{-1}$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ In this case, $AX = XΛ$, in other words,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \bmat{ ＆＆ ᜶ ＆ A ＆ ᜶ ＆＆ } ⦉

      ‖ \bmat{x_1 ＆ ⋯ ＆ x_m} = ⦉

      ‖ \bmat{x_1 ＆ ⋯ ＆ x_m} ⦉

      ‖ \bmat{λ_1 ＆＆ ᜶ ＆ ⋱ ＆ ᜶＆＆ λ_n}. ⦉

      ‖ ⦉
    ⦉

    ‖ in which $x_i$ is the $i$th column of $X$ and $λ_i$ is
      the $i$th diagonal element of $Λ$. ⦉

    ‖ We have $Ax_i = λ_ix_i$ for $i = 1, …, n$. ⦉

    ‖ In other words, the $i$th column of $X$ is an eigenvector
      of $A$ and the $j$th entry of $Λ$ is the corresponding
      eigenvalue. ⦉⦉
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ If $X$ is orthonormal, so that $X^{-1} = X^⊤$, then we
      can interpret such a decomposition as a change of basis to
      ❬eigenvector coordinates❭. ⦉

    ‖ If $Ax = b$, and $A = XΛX^{-1}$ then $(X^{-1}b) =
      Λ(X^{-1}x)$. ⦉

    ‖ Here, $X^{-1}x$ expands $x$ is the basis of columns of
      $X$. ⦉

    ‖ So to compute $Ax$ , we first expand into the basis of
      columns of $X$, scale by $Λ$, and then interpret the
      result as the coefficients of a linear combination of the
      columns of $X$. ⦉
  ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ In this case that $A = XΛX^⊤$ for an eigenvalue
    decomposition $(X, Λ)$ of $A$, we can also write
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ A = XΛX^⊤ = ∑_{i = 1}^{n} Λ_{ii}x_ix_i^⊤. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Every real symmetric matrix has an eigenvalue decomposition
    $(X, Λ)$ in which $X$ is orthonormal.
    † ⦊
      ‖ In future editions, this may be the motivating result
        for the definition of eigenvalues. ⦉
