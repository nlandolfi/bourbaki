§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $G = (S, ·)$ is a group. ⦉

  ‖ The group $G$ is ❬cyclic❭ (a ❬cyclic group❭) if, there
    exits an element $x ∈ S$, so that for every element $y ∈
    S$, there is an $n ∈ 𝗡$ such that $y = x^n$. ⦉

  ‖ We call the element $x$ the ❬cyclic generator❭. ⦉
⦉

§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Recall that the integers $𝗭$ form an additive group under
    the usual addition. ⦉

  ‖ In fact, $𝗭$ is a cyclic group with cyclic generator $1$. ⦉

  ‖ Indeed, $-1$ is alsoa cyclic generator. ⦉

  ‖ There are no other generators. ⦉
