\ssection{Definition}

A \t{code} for a set $X$ \t{in} an \t{alphabet} (finite set) $A$ is a function from $X$ to all finite sequences in $A$.
The \t{length} of an object (w.r.t to a code $C: X \to A$) is the length of the sequence $C(x)$.
A code is \t{nonsignular} if it is injective.

The \t{extension} of a code for $X$ is a function on finite length sequences of objects in $X$ to finite length sequences of objects in $A$ defined inductively by ....
A code is \t{uniquely decodable} if its extension is injective.

\ssection{Examples}

\ssection{Prefix-free codes}

A code $C: X \to \CA$ is \t{prefix-free} if, for all $x \in X$, $C(x)$ is not a prefix\footnote{To be defined.} of $C(x')$ for all $x' \neq x \in X$.
Prefix-free codes are nice because they are uniquely decodable.
The converse, is not true.

\begin{proposition}
  There exists a set $X$, alphabet $A$, and \textit{not} prefix-free code $C: X \to \CA$ such that $C$ is uniquely decodable.
  \begin{proof}
  Try $X = \set{A, B}$, $D = \set{0, 1}$ and $C(A) = (0)$ , $C(B) = 01$.
  Proof by induction on the length of the sequence, base case length 1 and length 2 sequences.\footnote{Future editions will expand on this account.}
  \end{proof}
\end{proposition}
