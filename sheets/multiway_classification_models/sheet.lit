§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬two-sample model❭ (or the ❬two-sample problem❭) has
    input space $\set{1, 2}$ and regression function $φ: \set{1,
    2} → 𝗥^2$ where $φ(1) = \transpose{(1, 0)}$ and $φ(2) =
    \transpose{(0, 1)}$. ⦉

  ‖ In this case, we model two populations (corresponding to 1
    and 2) with different means but a common variance. ⦉

  ‖ The regression range is the set $\set{(1, 0), (0, 1)}$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Generalizing from two to $a$ populations gives the ❬one-way
    classification model❭. ⦉

  ‖ In that case the input space is $\set{1, …, a}$ and the
    regression function is $φ: \set{1, …, a} → 𝗥^a$ defined by
    $φ(i) = e_i$ where $e_i$ is the standard unit vector in
    $𝗥^a$.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will define the standard unit vector. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ The regression range is $\set{e_1, …, e_a}$. ⦉

  ‖ In this case we say that the ❬factor❭ population takes
    ❬levels❭ $1, …, a$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ If there are more than one factors, then we have a
    ❬multiway classification model❭. ⦉

  ‖ For example, the ❬two-way classification model with no
    interaction❭ has input domain $X = \set{1, …, a} ×\set{1, …,
    b}$ and the regression function $φ: X → 𝗥^{a + b}$ is
    defined by $φ(i, j) = \transpose{(e_i, e_j)}$. ⦉
