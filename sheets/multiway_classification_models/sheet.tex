\section*{Definition}

The \t{two-sample model} (or the \t{two-sample problem}) has input space $\set{1, 2}$ and regression function $\phi : \set{1, 2} \to \R ^2$ where $\phi (1) = \transpose{(1, 0)}$ and $\phi (2) = \transpose{(0, 1)}$.
In this case, we model two populations (corresponding to 1 and 2) with different means but a common variance.
The regression range is the set $\set{(1, 0), (0, 1)}$.

Generalizing from two to $a$ populations gives the \t{one-way classification model}.
In that case the input space is $\set{1, \dots , a}$ and the regression function is $\phi : \set{1, \dots , a} \to \R ^a$ defined by $\phi (i) = e_i$ where $e_i$ is the standard unit vector in $\R ^a$.\footnote{Future editions will define the standard unit vector.}
The regression range is $\set{e_1, \dots , e_a}$.
In this case we say that the \t{factor} population takes \t{levels} $1, \dots , a$.

If there are more than one factors, then we have a \t{multiway classification model}.
For example, the \t{two-way classification model with no interaction} has input domain $X = \set{1, \dots , a} \times \set{1, \dots , b}$ and the regression function $\phi : X \to \R ^{a + b}$ is defined by $\phi (i, j) = \transpose{(e_i, e_j)}$.
