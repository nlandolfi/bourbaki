\section*{Result}

\begin{proposition}
Suppose $A$ and $B$ are finite sets.
Then $\num{A \times  B} = \num{A} \times  \num{B}$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}The proof involves induction on the size of one of the sets, and will, I believe, use the result of the number of a disjoint union; thus the dependence on the sheet \sheetref{number_of_disjoint_unions}{Number of Disjoint Unions}.\end{proof}
This is often called the \t{multiplication principle}, \t{rule of product}, or the \t{fundamental principle of counting}.
