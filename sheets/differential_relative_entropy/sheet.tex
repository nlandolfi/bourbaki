\ssection{Why}

We want relative entropy for densities.

\ssection{What}

The differential relative entropy of
a second density with respect to the
first density is the cross entropy
of the second with respect to the first
less the differential entropy of the first.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $f$ and $g$ be densities.
The relative entropy of $f$ with respect to $g$
is
\[
  h(g, f) - h(f)
\]
