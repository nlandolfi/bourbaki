\section*{Why}

We want relative entropy for densities.

\section*{What}

The differential relative entropy of a second density with respect to the first density is the cross entropy of the second with respect to the first less the differential entropy of the first.

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $f$ and $g$ be densities.
The relative entropy of $f$ with respect to $g$ is
    \[
h(g, f) - h(f)
    \]
