\stitle{Surjective Functions}

\ssection{Why}

The range need not equal the codomain; though it,
like every other image, is a subset of the codomain.


\ssection{Definition}

The function \rt{maps}{functionmaps} to domain
\ct{on}{functionon} to the codomain if the
range and codomain are equal;
in this case we call the function \ct{onto}{onto}.
This language suggests that every element of
the codomain is used by the function.
It means that for each element of the codomain,
we can find an element of the domain whose result is that first element of the codomain.

We also call the function \ct{surjective}{}.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $f: A \to B$.
Using prior notation, we can
state that $f$ is onto by
writing $f(A) = B$.
