\section*{Why}

By set we mean any aggregate or group, considered as a whole.
Examples are ubiquitous.

\section*{Examples}

A pack of wolves, a bunch of grapes, or a flock of pigeons are all examples of sets of things.
We can readily visualize each member of these sets.

The hairs on your head, the grains of sand on the beaches of Earth, the blades of grass in a field are all examples of sets.
Although we can not readily visualize all the elements at once, we can conceive of them, and visualize the elements one by one.
