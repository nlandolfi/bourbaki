\ssection{Why}

We generalize the algebraic structure of addition over the integers.

\ssection{Definition}

A \t{group} is an \rt{algebra} with:
(1) an associative operation,
(2) an identity element, and
(3) an inverse for each element.
We call the operation of the algebra \t{group addition}.
A \t{commutative group} is a group whose operation commutes.
A commutative group is also sometimes called an \t{Abelian group}.
