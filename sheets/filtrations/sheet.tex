\ssection{Definition}

Let $(I, \leq)$ be a totally ordered set.
A family of sigma-algebras $\set{F_i}_{i \in I}$ is a \t{filtration} if $F_{j} \subset F_{k}$ for all $j \leq k$.

We call a filtration whose index set is the natural numbers with their usual order a \t{discrete-time filtration}.
We call a filtration whose index set is the real numbers with their usual order a \t{continuous-time filtration}.
The index set may also be finite, for example, $\set{F_i}_{i = 1}^{n}$, in which case
\[
F_1 \subset F_2 \subset \cdots \subset F_n.
\]

\ssection{Notation}
It is extremely common to see filtrations written with the caligraphic $\mathcal{F} $.
As in, let $\set{\mathcal{F} _{i}}_{i=1}^{n}$ be a filtration.
This is in accordance with using caligraphic letters for sets of sets, and in accordance with the term sigma \textit{field} for sigma algebra.
