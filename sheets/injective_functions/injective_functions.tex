\stitle{Injective Functions}

\ssection{Why}

An element of the codomain may be the result
of several elements of the domain.
This overlapping, using an element of the
codomain more than once, is a regular occurrence.

\ssection{Definition}

If a function is a unique correspondence in that
every domain element has a different result,
we call it \ct{one-to-one}{one-to-one}.
This language is meant to suggest that each
element of the domain corresponds to one and
exactly one element of the codomain, and vice versa.

We also call such functions \ct{injective}{}.
