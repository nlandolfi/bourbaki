\ssection{Why}

TODO.
I wanted principal submatrix.


\ssection{Definition}

An \t{index set} of $\upto{n}$ is a subset of $\upto{n}$.
A \t{submatrix} of an $m \times n$ matrix is a matrix whose are selected according to (TODO) an index set of $\upto{m}$ and index set of $\upto{n}$; we call the first index set the \t{row index set} and the second index set the \t{column index set}.
A \t{principal submatrix} is the submatrix selected when the row and column index sets are identical.

A \t{sequential partition} of $\upto{n}$ is a sequence of index sets such that all elements of a later piece of the partition are larger (in the natural order) than all elements in all previous pieces.
