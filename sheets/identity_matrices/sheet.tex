\ssection{Why}

\ssection{Definition}

The identity function is linear.
Thus it corresponds to a
matrix. For a $d$-dimensional
space, the identity matrix
is the matrix corresponding
to the linear identity function.
We can show that this matrix
has ones on the diagonal and
zeros on the off diagonal.

\subsection{Notation}

We denote the identity
matrix by $I$.
