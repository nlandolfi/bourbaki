\ssection{Why}

We want the a field which corresponds to points on the real line.\footnote{Future editions are likely to modify this why.}

\ssection{Definition}

An ordered field\footnote{To be defined in future editions, but we take the usual definition of a field with an order. See, for example \sheetref{rational_order}{Rational Order} or \sheetref{real_order}{Real Order}).} is \t{complete} if every nonempty subset bounded from above has a least upper bound.
