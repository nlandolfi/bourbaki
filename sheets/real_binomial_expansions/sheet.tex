\begin{proposition}
Suppose $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.
For any natural number $n$,
\[
(x+y)^n = \sum_{k = 0}^{n} {n \choose k} x^{k}y^{n-k}
\]
\begin{proof}Roughly speaking, expand $(a+b)^n$ using the distributive law, and count the number of terms containing $k$ $x$'s and $n-k$ $y$'s.
The number will be same as the number of ways of choosing $k$ elements out of $n$, which is ${n \choose k}$.
Each such term contributes $x^ky^{n-k}$ to the sum.
Future editions will include a full proof, and perhaps some visualization.\end{proof}
\end{proposition}

The expression $x+y$ is called a \t{binomial} and this result is often called the \t{binomial formula}, \t{binomial theorem}, \t{binomial identity}.
For these reasons, ${n \choose k}$ is often called a \t{binomial coefficient}.
