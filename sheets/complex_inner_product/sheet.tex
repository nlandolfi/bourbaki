\section*{Definition}

The \t{complex inner product} (or \t{dot product}, \t{scalar product}) of two complex vectors $x, y \in \C ^n$ is
\[
x_1y_1 + x_2y_2 + \cdots + x_ny_n
\]
We denote the inner product of $x$ and $y$ by $\ip{x,y}$.

An \t{inner product space} is tuple whose first object is a vector space over the real or complex numbers and whose second object is a conforming inner product.

\subsection*{Other terminlogy}

Some older authors use the term \t{pre-Hilbert space}.
