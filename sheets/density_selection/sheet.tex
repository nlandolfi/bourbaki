\ssection{Why}

We have a dataset in some infinite
set and want to summarize it by a
probability density.

\ssection{Overview}

We have an set uncountable set of outcomes
$A$. We have
a dataset $(a^1, \dots, a^n)$. We want
to define a correspondence between the
dataset and probability densities over
the set of outcomes $A$.

We will call proposals for such a
correspondence
\ct{principles of density selection}{}.

Notice that we do not want a density
on the record sequences, we want a density
on $A$ on $A^n$.
