§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ How can we construct distributions which factor according to
    a directed graph.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions might flip the order of this sheet with
        that of directed graph distributions since, in the genetic
        approach, in may be more natural to think of constructing
        such distributions before analyzing them. This is partially
        motivated by the acyclic constraint here, which restricts
        the graphs according to which a distribution can factor. ⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $\bar{G} = (G, A)$ be a typed graph (see␣
    <a href='/sheets/function_graphs.html'>
      ‖ Function Graphs ⦉
    </a>
    ) with directed and acyclic $G$. ⦉

  ‖ For source vertices $i$, let $g_i: A_i → [0, 1]$ be a
    distribution and otherwise let $g_{i}: A_{\pa_i} → [0, 1]$
    denote a conditional distribution so that $g$ is a sequence
    of functions. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We call the ordered pair $(\bar{G}, g)$ a ❬distribution
    graph❭ (or ❬distribution network❭, ❬conditional distribution
    network❭, ❬conditional distribution graph❭, ❬bayesian network❭,
    † ⦊
      ‖ Indeed, this term is near universal in certain
        literatures. We avoid it in these sheets as a result of
        the Bourbaki project's policy on naming. ⦉
    ⦉
    ❬directed probabilistic graphical model❭). ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬distribution❭ of $(\bar{G}, g)$ is the function $p:
    ∏_{i} A_i → [0, 1]$ defined by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ p(a) ∏_{\pa_i = ∅} g_i(a_i) ∏_{\pa_i ≠ ∅} g_{i |\pa_i}
        g_i(a_i, a_{\pa_i}). ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ It is, of course, a distribution. ⦉

  ‖ And it factors according to the directed and acyclic graph
    $G$. ⦉
