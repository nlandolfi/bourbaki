§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Consider a metric space. ⦉

  ‖ A subset of the base set is ❬dense❭ in the base set if
    every element of the base set is the limit of elements in
    the subset. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(A, d)$ be a metric space. ⦉

  ‖ Let $B ⊂ A$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $B$ is dense in $A$ if ⦉

  ‖ for each $a ∈ A$ there exists ⦉

  ‖ $\seq{b}$ in $B$ so that ⦉

  ‖ $\seqt{b} → a$. ⦉
