\ssection{Why}

What if we do maximum likelihood and we only consider tree normal densities.

\ssection{Definition}

Let $x^1, \dots, x^n$ be a dataset in $\R^d$.
We want to find the multivariate normal which factors according to a tree which has maximal likelihood on the dataset.

\ssection{Results}
