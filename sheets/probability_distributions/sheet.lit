¬ß Why ‚¶â
¬∂ ‚¶ä
  ‚Äñ To talk about uncertain outcomes, we assign credibility to
    each outcome according to our intuition of proportion.
    ‚Ä† ‚¶ä
      ‚Äñ Future editions may drop the dependence on real numbers,
        and use intuition of repeated trials to introduce
        ‚Äπrational‚Ä∫ probability distributions. ‚¶â
    ‚¶â‚¶â
‚¶â

¬ß Definition ‚¶â
¬∂ ‚¶ä
  ‚Äñ A ‚ù¨probability distribution‚ù≠ (or ‚ù¨probability mass function‚ù≠
    (‚ù¨pmf‚ù≠), or ‚ù¨proportion distribution‚ù≠) is a real-valued
    function from a finite set of outcomes which is non-negative
    and normalized. ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ A real-valued function on a finite set is ‚ù¨normalized‚ù≠ if
    the sum of its results is 1. ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ We will refer to these as ‚ù¨distributions‚ù≠. ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ The ‚ù¨probability of an outcome‚ù≠ is the result of the
    outcome under the distribution. ‚¶â
‚¶â

¬∂ ‚¶ä
  ‚Äñ The probability of an outcome is meant to indicate the
    credibility of an outcome. ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ The word probabiliy has its roots in the English word
    probable, which has the Middle English sense ‚Äúworthy of
    belief}. ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ The probability of an outcome models how worthy of belief
    it is, relative to other outcomes. ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ In the case of flipping a coin, or rolling a die, all
    outcomes are equally worthy of belief. ‚¶â
‚¶â

¬∂ ‚¶ä
  ‚Äñ When an outcome has a higher probability than a second
    outcome we say that the first is ‚ù¨more probable‚ù≠ than the
    second. ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ Similarly we say that the first outcome is ‚ù¨less probable‚ù≠
    than the second outcome if it has higher probability than
    the second. ‚¶â
‚¶â

¬ß¬ß Notation ‚¶â
¬∂ ‚¶ä
  ‚Äñ Let $A$ be a set and let $p: A ‚Üí ùó•$ be a distribution. ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ Then
    ‚óá ‚¶ä
      ‚Äñ \textstyle ‚¶â

      ‚Äñ p(a) ‚â• 0 \text{ for all } a ‚àà A \text{ and } ‚àë_{a ‚àà
        A} p(a) = 1. ‚¶â
    ‚¶â‚¶â
‚¶â

¬∂ ‚¶ä
  ‚Äñ \begin{proposition} ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ For all $a ‚àà A$, $p(a) ‚â§ 1$. ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ \begin{proof} ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ Let $a ‚àà A$. ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ By definition, $p(a) ‚â• 0$.. ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ Second, since $p$ is normalized, $p(a) ‚â§ ‚àë_{b ‚àà A} p(b) =
    1$. ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ \end{proof} ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ \end{proposition} ‚¶â
‚¶â

¬ß Example: coin ‚¶â
¬∂ ‚¶ä
  ‚Äñ When flipping a coin, both a heads and a tails are equally
    worthy of belief. ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ Thus we say that the outcome $0$ (tails) has probability
    $\nicefrac{1}{2}$ and likewise for the outcome $1$ (heads) ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ In this case we say that we are modeling a ‚ù¨fair coin‚ù≠. ‚¶â
‚¶â

¬ß Example: die ‚¶â
¬∂ ‚¶ä
  ‚Äñ When rolling a die, all six sides are equally worthy of
    belief. ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ Thus we say that the outcomes $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$ each
    have probability $\nicefrac{1}{6}$. ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ Prior to roll, each is equally credible. ‚¶â

  ‚Äñ In this case we say that we are modeing a ‚ù¨fair die‚ù≠. ‚¶â
