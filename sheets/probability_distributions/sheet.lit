§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ To talk about uncertain outcomes, we assign credibility to
    each outcome according to our intuition of proportion.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions may drop the dependence on real numbers,
        and use intuition of repeated trials to introduce
        ‹rational› probability distributions. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬probability distribution❭ (or ❬distribution❭, ❬probability
    mass function❭, ❬pmf❭, ❬proportion distribution❭) is a
    real-valued function from a finite set of outcomes which is
    non-negative and normalized. ⦉

  ‖ A real-valued function on a finite set is ❬normalized❭ if
    the sum of its results is 1. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬probability of an outcome❭ is the result of the
    outcome under the distribution. ⦉

  ‖ The probability of an outcome is meant to indicate the
    credibility of an outcome. ⦉

  ‖ The word probabiliy has its roots in the English word
    probable, which has the Middle English sense “worthy of
    belief”. ⦉

  ‖ The probability of an outcome models how worthy of belief
    it is, relative to other outcomes. ⦉

  ‖ In the case of flipping a coin, or rolling a die, we may
    assert that all outcomes are equally worthy of belief. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ When an outcome has a higher probability than a second
    outcome we say that the first is ❬more probable❭ than the
    second. ⦉

  ‖ Similarly we say that the first outcome is ❬less probable❭
    than the second outcome if it has higher probability than
    the second. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A$ be a set and let $p: A → 𝗥$ be a distribution. ⦉

  ‖ Then
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \textstyle ⦉

      ‖ p(a) ≥ 0 \text{ for all } a ∈ A \text{ and } ∑_{a ∈
        A} p(a) = 1. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

§§ Simple consequences of definition ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Suppose $p: A → 𝗥$ is a distribution. ⦉

  ‖ For all $a ∈ A$, $p(a) ≤ 1$. ⦉
  <proof>
    ‖ Let $a ∈ A$. ⦉

    ‖ By definition, $p(a) ≥ 0$. ⦉

    ‖ Second, since $p$ is normalized, $p(a) ≤ ∑_{b ∈ A} p(b)
      = 1$. ⦉
  </proof>
</statement>
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Consequently, the␣
    <a href='/sheets/relations.html#Domain_and_range'>
      ‖ range ⦉
    </a>
    ␣of $p$ is contained in $[0,1]$. ⦉

  ‖ For this reason, we often introduce a distribution with the
    notation $p: A → [0,1]$; notice the codomain here is the
    interval $[0,1]$ and ‹not› the real numbers $𝗥$. ⦉
⦉

§ Example: coin ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ When␣
    <a href='/sheets/uncertain_outcomes.html#Example:_coin'>
      ‖ flipping a coin ⦉
    </a>
    , both a heads and a tails are equally worthy of belief. ⦉

  ‖ Thus we say that the outcome $0$ (tails) has probability
    $½$ and likewise for the outcome $1$ (heads). ⦉

  ‖ (Recall that we associate the outcome tails to the number 0
    and heads to the number 1.) ⦉

  ‖ We speak of modeling a ❬fair coin❭. ⦉

  ‖ Neither heads nor tails is ‹more› or ‹less› probable. ⦉
⦉

§ Example: die ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ When␣
    <a href='/sheets/uncertain_outcomes.html#Example:_die'>
      ‖ rolling a die ⦉
    </a>
    , all six sides are equally worthy of belief. ⦉

  ‖ Thus we say that the outcomes $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$ each
    have probability $⅙$. ⦉

  ‖ Prior to the roll, each is equally credible. ⦉

  ‖ We speak of modeling a ❬fair die❭. ⦉

  ‖ No outcome is ‹more› or ‹less› probable than any other. ⦉
