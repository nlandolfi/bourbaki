§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ To talk about uncertain outcomes, we assign credibility to
    each outcome according to our intuition of proportion.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions may drop the dependence on real numbers,
        and use intuition of repeated trials to introduce
        ‹rational› probability distributions. ⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬probability distribution❭ (or ❬probability mass function❭
    (❬pmf❭), or ❬proportion distribution❭) is a real-valued
    function from a finite set of outcomes which is non-negative
    and normalized. ⦉

  ‖ A real-valued function on a finite set is ❬normalized❭ if
    the sum of its results is 1. ⦉

  ‖ We will refer to these as ❬distributions❭. ⦉

  ‖ The ❬probability of an outcome❭ is the result of the
    outcome under the distribution. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The probability of an outcome is meant to indicate the
    credibility of an outcome. ⦉

  ‖ The word probabiliy has its roots in the English word
    probable, which has the Middle English sense “worthy of
    belief}. ⦉

  ‖ The probability of an outcome models how worthy of belief
    it is, relative to other outcomes. ⦉

  ‖ In the case of flipping a coin, or rolling a die, all
    outcomes are equally worthy of belief. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ When an outcome has a higher probability than a second
    outcome we say that the first is ❬more probable❭ than the
    second. ⦉

  ‖ Similarly we say that the first outcome is ❬less probable❭
    than the second outcome if it has higher probability than
    the second. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $A$ be a set and let $p: A → 𝗥$ be a distribution. ⦉

  ‖ Then
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \textstyle ⦉

      ‖ p(a) ≥ 0 \text{ for all } a ∈ A \text{ and } ∑_{a ∈
        A} p(a) = 1. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ For all $a ∈ A$, $p(a) ≤ 1$. ⦉
  <proof>
    ‖ Let $a ∈ A$. ⦉

    ‖ By definition, $p(a) ≥ 0$.. ⦉

    ‖ Second, since $p$ is normalized, $p(a) ≤ ∑_{b ∈ A} p(b)
      = 1$. ⦉
  </proof>
</statement>

§ Example: coin ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ When flipping a coin, both a heads and a tails are equally
    worthy of belief. ⦉

  ‖ Thus we say that the outcome $0$ (tails) has probability
    $½$ and likewise for the outcome $1$ (heads) ⦉

  ‖ In this case we say that we are modeling a ❬fair coin❭. ⦉
⦉

§ Example: die ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ When rolling a die, all six sides are equally worthy of
    belief. ⦉

  ‖ Thus we say that the outcomes $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$ each
    have probability $⅙$. ⦉

  ‖ Prior to roll, each is equally credible. ⦉

  ‖ In this case we say that we are modeing a ❬fair die❭. ⦉
