\ssection{Why}

We want to talk about probability over finite sets.

\ssection{Definition}

A \t{probability distribution} or \t{probability mass function} is a real-valued function from a set of outcomes which is non-negative and normalized.
A real-valued function on a finite set is \t{normalized} if the sum of its results is 1.
We will refer to these as \t{distributions}.
The \t{probability of an outcome} is the result of the outcome under the distribution.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $A$ be a set of outcomes and let $p: A \to \R$ be a distribution.
Then
\[
  p(a) \geq 0 \text{ for all } a \in A \text{ and } \sum_{a \in A} p(a) = 1.
\]

\begin{prop}
If $p: A \to \R$ is a distribution, then $p(A) \subset [0, 1]$.
\begin{proof}

Let $a \in A$.
First, $p(a) \geq 0$ by definition.
Second, since $p$ is normalized, $\sum_{b \in A} p(b) = 1$.
And $p(a) \leq \sum_{b \in A} p(b)$, so $p(a) \leq 1$.

\end{proof}

\end{prop}
