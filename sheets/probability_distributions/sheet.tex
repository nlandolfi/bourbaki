\ssection{Why}

We want to talk about probability over finite sets.

\ssection{Definition}

A \t{probability distribution} or \t{probability mass function} is a real-valued function from a set of outcomes which is non-negative and normalized.
A real-valued function on a finite set is \ct{normalized}{} if the sum of its results is 1.
We will refer to these as \t{distributions}.
The \t{probability of an outcome}{} is the result of the outcome under the distribution.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $A$ be a set of outcomes and
Let $p: \Outcomes \to \R$ satisfy

\begin{itemize}

\item $p(a) > 0$ for each $a \in A$ and
\item $\sum_{a \in A} p(a) = 1$

\end{itemize}
