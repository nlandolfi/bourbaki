\ssection{Why}

We want to talk about
probability over finite
sets.

\ssection{Definition}

A
\ct{probability distribution}{}
or
\ct{probability mass function}{}
is a real-valued function
from a set of outcomes which is
non-negative and normalized.
A real-valued function on a finite set
is \ct{normalized}{} if the sum over
its results is 1.

The \ct{probability of an outcome}{}
is the result of the outcome
under the probability mass function.
When the context is clear, we refer
to such a function as a \ct{distribution}{}.
We say that the distribution is \ct{over}{}
outcomes.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $A$ be a set of outcomes and
Let $p: \Outcomes \to \R$ satisfy

\begin{itemize}

\item $p(a) > 0$ for each $a \in A$ and
\item $\sum_{a \in A} p(a) = 1$

\end{itemize}
