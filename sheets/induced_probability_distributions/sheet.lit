§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We can interpret the codomain of a random variable as a
    new sample space, since the underlying probability distribution
    induces a new probability distribution. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $p: Ω → 𝗥$ be a probability distribution and $x: Ω →
    V$ an outcome variable. Define $q: V → 𝗥$ by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ q(a) = 𝗣[x = a]. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Since events $x^{-1}(a)$ for $a ∈ V$ partition $Ω$, $∑_{a ∈
    A} q(a) = 1$. ⦉

  ‖ We call $q$ the ❬induced distribution❭ (or ❬induced
    probability mass function❭) of the random variable $x$. ⦉

  ‖ Thus we can think of $V$ as a set of outcomes, which we
    call the outcomes ❬induced❭ by $x$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ It is common to denote it by $p_{x}$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ If $x: Ω → V$ is a random variable and $f: V → U$, then
    if we define $y: Ω → V$ so that $y \equiv f(x)$, $y$ is
    a random variable with induced distribution $p_{y}: Ω → 𝗥$
    satisfying
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \textstyle ⦉

      ‖ p_{y}(b) = ∑_{a ∈ V | y(a) = b} p_x(a). ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ As a matter of practical computation, we can evaluate
    probabilities having to do with the outcome variable $x$
    using $p_x$ instead of $p$. ⦉

  ‖ For example with $x$ as in the example above, $𝗣(x = 4
    \text{ or } x = 5) = p_x(4) + p_x(5)$, rather than $∑_{ω
    ∈ Ω | x(ω) = 4 \text{ or } x(ω) = 5} p(ω)$. ⦉
