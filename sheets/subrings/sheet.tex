\ssection{Definition}
Let $(R, +, \cdot )$ be a ring.
A ring $(S, +, \cdot )$ is \t{subring} of $(R, +, \cdot )$ if $S \subset R$.

\ssection{Verification}
If $(R, +, \cdot )$ and $S \subset R$, then $+$ is associative and commutative on $S$ because it is on $R$, $\cdot $ is associative and $+$ and $\cdot $ distribute over each other for the same reason.
So we have restricted the number of conditions to check, and arrive at our first statement of sufficient conditions on $S$ that ensure $(S, +, \cdot )$ is a ring.
