§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Recall that $(C, 𝗖mod{·})$ is a normed space, and so also
    a metric space. ⦉

  ‖ So, a sequence $(z_n)_{n ∈ 𝗡}$ of complex numbers is
    egoprox and convergent as usual. ⦉

  ‖ Both of these are equivalent to the corresponding conditions
    on the sequences of real and imaginary parts. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ $(z_n)_{n ∈ 𝗡} = (x_n, y_n)_{n ∈ 𝗡}$ converges to $z_0 =
    (x_0, y_0) ∈ 𝗖$ if and only if $x_n$ converges to $x_0$
    and $y_n$ converges to $y_0$. ⦉
</statement>
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ $(z_n)_{n ∈ 𝗡} = (x_n, y_n)_{n ∈ 𝗡}$ is egoprox if and
    only if $x_n$ is egoprox and $y_n$ is egoprox. ⦉
</statement>

§ Completeness ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ As a result of the second proposition, if $z_n$ is egoprox
    then there is a limit $x_0$ and $y_0$ for its real and
    imaginary pieces, and so as a result of the first
    proposition, $z_n$ converges. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, every cauchy sequence converges. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ $𝗖$ with the metric induced by $𝗖mod{·}$ is complete. ⦉
