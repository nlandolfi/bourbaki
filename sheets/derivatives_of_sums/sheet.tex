\section*{Why}

Is the sum of two differentiable functions differentiable?
What is the derivative of the function which is their sum?

\section*{Result}

\begin{proposition}
Suppose $I \subset \R $ is an interval and $f, g: I \to \R $ are differentiable.
Then $f + g$ is a differentiable function whose derivative is $f' + g'$
\end{proposition}
