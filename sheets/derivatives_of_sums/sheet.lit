§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Is the sum of two differentiable functions differentiable? ⦉

  ‖ What is the derivative of the function which is their sum? ⦉
⦉

§ Result ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Suppose $I ⊂ 𝗥$ is an interval and $f, g: I → 𝗥$ are
    differentiable. ⦉

  ‖ Then $f + g$ is a differentiable function whose derivative
    is $f' + g'$ ⦉
