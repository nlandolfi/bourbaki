\ssection{Why}

We approximate with tree distributions.
These distributions require tabulating fewer numbers in order to express the probability of an outcome, which may save us tabulating many more numbers.

\ssection{Problem}

We approximate a distribution by a tree distribution using the relative entropy as a criterion.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $A_1, \dots, A_n$ be finite non-empty sets and define $A = \prod_{i = 1}^{n} A_i$.
Let $q: A \to [0, 1]$ a distribution.
Let $d$ denote the relative
entropy.

We want to find a distribution $p$
on $A$ and tree $T$ on
$\set{1, \dots, n}$ to
\[
  \begin{aligned}
    \text{minimize}   &\quad d(q, p) \\
    \text{subject to} &\quad p \text{ factors according to the tree } T
  \end{aligned}
\]

\ssection{Solution}

\begin{prop}
  Let $q$ be a distribution on $A$. Let $T$ be
  a tree on $\set{1, \dots, d}$. Let $p_j$ be
  the parent of vertex $j$ for the $T$ rooted
  at vertex $i$, $j = 1,\dots,n$ and $j \neq i$.
  Then the distribution $p$ on $A$ defined by
  \[
    p = q_i \prod_{j \neq i} q_{j \mid p_j}
  \]
  achieves minimum entropy relative to $q$ among
  all distributions which factor according to $T$.
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}
  Let $q$ be a distribution on $A$. Let $T$ be
  a tree on $\set{1, \dots, d}$. Let $p_j$ be
  the parent of vertex $j$ for the $T$ rooted
  at vertex $i$, $j = 1,\dots,n$ and $j \neq i$.
  Then the distribution $p$ on $A$ defined by
  \[
    p = q_i \prod_{j \neq i} q_{j \mid p_j}
  \]
  achieves minimum entropy relative to $q$ among
  all distributions which factor according to $T$.
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}
  Let $q$ be a distribution on $A$.
  A tree
  $T$ is a solution to the problem above
  if and only if it is a minimum spanning
  tree of the mutual information graph of $q$.
\end{prop}
