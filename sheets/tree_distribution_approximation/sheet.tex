\ssection{Why}

We approximate with tree distributions.
These distributions require tabulating fewer numbers in order to express the probability of an outcome.

\ssection{Problem}

We approximate a given distribution by a tree distribution approximant, using the entropy of the approximant relative to the given distribution as the criterion of approximation.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $A_1, \dots, A_n$ be finite non-empty sets and define $A = \prod_{i = 1}^{n} A_i$.
Let $q: A \to [0, 1]$ a distribution.
Let $d$ denote the relative
entropy.

We want to find a distribution $p$ on $A$ and tree $T$ on $\set{1, \dots, n}$ to
\[
  \begin{aligned}
    \text{minimize}   &\quad d(q, p) \\
    \text{subject to} &\quad p \text{ factors according to the tree } T
  \end{aligned}
\]
