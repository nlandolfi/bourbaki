\section*{Why}

We generalize convex sets to arbitrary vector spaces.

\section*{Definition}

Suppose $V$ is a vector space over the real field $\R $.
A set $C \subset V$ is \t{convex} if it contains the closed line segment between every pair of distinct points.

In other words, a set $C \subset V$ is convex if
\[
\lambda x + (1-\lambda )y \in C \quad \text{for all } x, y \in C \text{ and } \lambda  \in [0,1].
\]
