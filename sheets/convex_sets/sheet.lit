§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We generalize convex sets to arbitrary vector spaces. ⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $X$ is a vector space over $𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ A set $C ⊂ X$ is ❬convex❭ if it contains the closed line
    segment between every pair of distinct points. ⦉

  ‖ In other words,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ λx + (1-λ)y ∈ C \quad \text{for all } x, y ∈ C
        \text{ and } λ ∈ [0,1]. ⦉
