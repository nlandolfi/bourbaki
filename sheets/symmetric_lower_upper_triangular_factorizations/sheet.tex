\section*{Why}

What of lower upper triangular factorizations when the system is symmetric?

\section*{Definition}

A \t{symmetric lower upper triangular factorization} of $A$ is a pair of matrices $(L \in \R ^{m \times m}, U \in \R ^{m \times m})$ where $L$ is unit lower triangular, $U$ is upper triangular and $A = LU$.
\[
A = L\transpose{L}.
\]
Other terminology includes \t{lower upper triangular factorization}, \t{LU decomposition}, \t{LU factorization}.
Define $R = \transpose{L}$, then
\[
A = \transpose{R}R.
\]

Let $A \in \R ^{n \times  n}$.
Then the ordinary row reduction of $A$ is a matrix $U$ which is upper triangular.be symmetric.
A \t{lower upper triangular decomposition}
$A$ is a pair of matrices $(L, \transpose{L})$ where $L \in \R ^{n \times n}$ is lower triangular, has nonnegative real diagonal entries, and satisfies
\[
A = L\transpose{L}.
\]
Other terminology includes \t{lower upper triangular factorization}, \t{LU decomposition}, \t{LU factorization}.
Define $R = \transpose{L}$, then
\[
A = \transpose{R}R.
\]

\section*{Basic properties}

\begin{proposition}
Let $A \in \R ^{m \times m}$ be positive definite. Then there exists unique lower triangular matrix $L \in \R ^{n \times n}$ so that
\[
A = L\transpose{L}.
\]
\end{proposition}

So, in the case that $A$ is positive definite, a lower upper triangular decomposition exists and is unique.
Therefore we refer to it as \t{the upper lower triangular decomposition} of $A$.
It is also known (universally) as the \t{Cholesky decomposition} or \t{Cholesky factorization} of $A$.

\begin{proposition}
If $A$ is positive semidefinite, there exists a permutation matrix $P$ for which there is a unique $L$ so that
\[
\transpose{P}AP = L\transpose{L}.
\]
\end{proposition}

This second proposition says that there is a unique Cholesky decomposition for a particular permutation (or pivoting) of $A$.

\section*{Unitriangular form}

A \t{lower diagonal upper decomposition} (or \t{lower diagonal upper factorization}) of a matrix $A$ a sequence $(L, D, \transpose{L})$ where $L \in \R ^{n \times n}$ is unit lower triangular, $D \in \R ^{n \times n}$ is diagonal with real nonnegative entries and
\[
A = LD\transpose{L}.
\]
Other terminology includes \t{LDL decomposition}, \t{LDL factorization}, \t{LDU factorization}, \t{LDU decomposition}.

If $(L \in \R ^{n \times n}, D \in \R ^{n \times n}, \transpose{L})$ is a LDU decomposition of $A \in \R ^{n \times n}$, then $(L\Msqrt{D}A = LD\transpose{L}$ then $(\tilde{L}\Msqrt{D}, \Msqrt{D}\transpose{L})$ is a LU decomposition.
Conversely, if $(B, \transpose{B})$ is a LU decomposition and $S$ is the diagonal matrix satisfying $S_{ii} = B_{ii}$ for $i = 1, \dots , n$, then $(B\inv{S}, S^2, \inv{S}\transpose{B})$ is a LDU decomposition of $A$.
