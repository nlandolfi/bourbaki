§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬symmetric lower upper triangular factorization❭ of $A$ is
    a pair of matrices $(L ∈ 𝗥^{m ×m}, U ∈ 𝗥^{m ×m})$ where
    $L$ is unit lower triangular, $U$ is upper triangular and $A
    = LU$. ⦉
  ◇ ⦊
    ‖ A = L\transpose{L}. ⦉

  ‖ Other terminology includes ❬lower upper triangular
    factorization❭, ❬LU decomposition❭, ❬LU factorization❭. ⦉

  ‖ Define $R = \transpose{L}$, then

  ‖ A ❬lower upper triangular decomposition❭ ⦉

  ‖ $A$ is a pair of matrices $(L, \transpose{L})$ where $L ∈
    𝗥^{n ×n}$ is lower triangular, has nonnegative real diagonal
    entries, and satisfies
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ A = L\transpose{L}. ⦉

§ Basic properties ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Let $A ∈ 𝗥^{m ×m}$ be positive definite. Then there exists
    unique lower triangular matrix $L ∈ 𝗥^{n ×n}$ so that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ A = L\transpose{L}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
</statement>
¶ ⦊
  ‖ So, in the case that $A$ is positive definite, a lower
    upper triangular decomposition exists and is unique. ⦉

  ‖ Therefore we refer to it as ❬the upper lower triangular
    decomposition❭ of $A$. ⦉

  ‖ It is also known (universally) as the ❬Cholesky
    decomposition❭ or ❬Cholesky factorization❭ of $A$. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ If $A$ is positive semidefinite, there exists a permutation
    matrix $P$ for which there is a unique $L$ so that ⦉

  ‖     ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \transpose{P}AP = L\transpose{L}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
</statement>
¶ ⦊
  ‖ This second proposition says that there is a unique Cholesky
    decomposition for a particular permutation (or pivoting) of
    $A$. ⦉

§ Unitriangular form ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬lower diagonal upper decomposition❭ (or ❬lower diagonal
    upper factorization❭) of a matrix $A$ a sequence $(L, D,
    \transpose{L})$ where $L ∈ 𝗥^{n ×n}$ is unit lower
    triangular, $D ∈ 𝗥^{n ×n}$ is diagonal with real nonnegative
    entries and
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ A = LD\transpose{L}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Other terminology includes ❬LDL decomposition❭, ❬LDL
    factorization❭, ❬LDU factorization❭, ❬LDU decomposition❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ If $(L ∈ 𝗥^{n ×n}, D ∈ 𝗥^{n ×n}, \transpose{L})$ is a LDU
    decomposition of $A ∈ 𝗥^{n ×n}$, then $(L\Msqrt{D}A =
    LD\transpose{L}$ then $(\tilde{L}\Msqrt{D},
    \Msqrt{D}\transpose{L})$ is a LU decomposition. ⦉

  ‖ Conversely, if $(B, \transpose{B})$ is a LU decomposition and
    $S$ is the diagonal matrix satisfying $S_{ii} = B_{ii}$ for
    $i = 1, …, n$, then $(B∈v{S}, S^2, ∈v{S}\transpose{B})$ is a
    LDU decomposition of $A$. ⦉
