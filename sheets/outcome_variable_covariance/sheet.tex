\section*{Why}

We want a measure of the \textit{spread} of a random variable.

\section*{Definition}

The \t{covariance} (or \t{variance}) of a random variable $x: \Omega  \to \R $ is $\E ((x - \E (x))^2)$, the expectation of the square of the random variable's distance from its mean.
The covariance measures the mean square difference from the mean.

\subsection*{Interpretation}

The covariance of $x$ summarizes how \say{wide} the induced distribution of $x$ is.
If the covariance is small, then the induced distribution is concentrated aroudn its mean.

Future editions will give example.

\subsection*{Notation}

We denote the covariance of $x$ by $\cov(x)$.
Another common notation is $\var(x)$.

\subsubsection*{Standard deviation}

If $x$ has units meters, then $\cov(x)$ has units square meters.
It can be useful to work instead with the \t{standard deviation} of $x$, defined as $\sqrt{\cov(x)}$, which has the same units as $x$.
We denote the standard deviation of $x$ by $\std(x)$.
