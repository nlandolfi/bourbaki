§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want a measure of the ‹spread› of a random variable. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬covariance❭ (or ❬variance❭) of a random variable $x: Ω
    → 𝗥$ is $𝗘((x - 𝗘(x))^2)$, the expectation of the square of
    the random variable’s distance from its mean. ⦉

  ‖ The covariance measures the mean square difference from the
    mean. ⦉
⦉

§§ Interpretation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The covariance of $x$ summarizes how “wide” the induced
    distribution of $x$ is. ⦉

  ‖ If the covariance is small, then the induced distribution is
    concentrated aroudn its mean.

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the covariance of $x$ by $\cov(x)$. ⦉

  ‖ Another common notation is $\var(x)$. ⦉
⦉

§§ Standard deviation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ If $x$ has units meters, then $\cov(x)$ has units square
    meters. ⦉

  ‖ It can be useful to work instead with the ❬standard
    deviation❭ of $x$, defined as $\sqrt{\cov(x)}$, which has the
    same units as $x$. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the standard deviation of $x$ by $\std(x)$. ⦉
