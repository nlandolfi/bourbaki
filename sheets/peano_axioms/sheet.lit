§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Historically considered a fountainhead for all of mathematics. ⦉
⦉

§ Discussion ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ So far we know that $ω$ is the unique smallest successor
    set. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, we know that $0 ∈ ω$, $n ∈ ω ⟹ \ssuc{n}
    ∈ ω$ and that if these two properties hold of some $S ⊂
    ω$, then $S = ω$. ⦉

  ‖ We can add two important statements to this list. ⦉

  ‖ First, that 0 is the successor of no number. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, $n^+ ≠ 0$ for all $n ∈ ω$. ⦉

  ‖ Second, that if two numbers have the same successor, then
    they are the same number ⦉

  ‖ In other words, $\ssuc{n} = \ssuc{m} ⟹ n = m$ ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ These five properties were historically considered the
    fountainhead of all of mathematics. ⦉

  ‖ One by the name of Peano used them to show the elementary
    properties of arithmetic. ⦉

  ‖ They are:
    𝍫 ⦊
      ‣ $0 ∈ ω$. ⦉

      ‣ $n ∈ ω ⟹ n^+ ∈ ω$ for all $n ∈ ω$. ⦉

      ‣ If $S$ is a successor set contained in $ω$, then $S =
        ω$. ⦉

      ‣ $\ssuc{n} ≠ 0$ for all $n ∈ ω$ ⦉

      ‣ $\ssuc{n} = \ssuc{m} ⟹ n = m$ for all $n, m ∈ ω$. ⦉

  ‖ These are collectively known as the ❬Peano axioms❭. ⦉

  ‖ Recall that the third statement in this list is the
    ❬principle of mathematical induction❭. ⦉

§ Statements ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Here are the statements. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition' text='Peano’s First Axiom'>
  ‖ $0 \in \omega$. ⦉
</statement>
<statement type='proposition' text='Peano’s Second Axiom'>
  ‖ $n \in \omega \implies n^+ \in \omega$. ⦉
</statement>
<statement type='proposition' text='Peano’s Third Axiom'>
  ‖ Suppose $S \subset \omega$, $0 \in S$, and $(n \in S
    \implies n^+ \in S$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $S = \omega$. ⦉
</statement>
<statement type='proposition' text='Peano’s Fourth Axiom'>
  ‖ $n^+ \neq 0$ for all $n \in \omega$. ⦉
</statement>
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The last one uses the following two useful facts. ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ $x \in n \implies n \not\subset x$. ⦉
</statement>
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ $(x \in y \land y \in n) \implies x \in n$ ⦉
</statement>
¶ ⦊
  ‖ This latter proposition is sometimes described by saying that
    $n$ is a ❬transitive set❭. ⦉

  ‖ This notion of transitivity is not the same as that
    described in␣<a href="/sheets/relations.html"> ‖ Relations⦉</a>. ⦉

  ‖ Using these one can show: ⦉
⦉

<statement type='proposition' text='Peano’s Fifth Axiom'>
  ‖ Suppose $n, m \in \omega$ with $n^+ = m^+$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $n = m$. ⦉
</statement>
