\section*{Why}

We want to generalize the notion of continuity.

\section*{Definition}

Let $X$ be a set.
A \t{topology} is a set of subsets of $X$ for which (1) the empty set base set are distinguished (2) the intersection of a \textit{finite} family of distinguished subsets is distinguished, and (3) the union of a family of distinguished subsets is distinguished.
We call the elements of the topology the \t{open sets}.

A \t{topological space} is an ordered pair: a base set and a set distinguished subsets of the base set which are a topology.

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $X$ be a non-empty set.
For the set of distinguished sets, we tend to use $\mathcal{T} $, a mnemonic for topology, read aloud as \say{script T}.
We tend to denote elements of $\mathcal{T} $ by $O$, a mnemonic for open.
We denote the topological space with base set $X$ and topology $\mathcal{T} $ by $(X, \mathcal{T} )$.
We denote the properties satisfied by elements of $\mathcal{T} $:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item $X, \varnothing \in \mathcal{T} $
      \item $\set{O_i}_{i = 1}^{n} \subset \mathcal{T}  \implies \cap _{i = 1}^{n} O_i \in \mathcal{T} $
      \item $\set{O_\alpha }_{\alpha  \in I} \subset \mathcal{T} \implies \cup_{\alpha  \in I} \in \mathcal{T} $
    \end{enumerate}

\section*{Examples}

$\R $ with the open intervals as the open sets is a topological space.
