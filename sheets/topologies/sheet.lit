§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to generalize the notion of continuity. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given a set $X$, a ❬topology❭ on $X$ is a set of subsets
    of $X$ for which (1) the empty set base set are
    distinguished (2) the intersection of a ‹finite› family of
    distinguished subsets is distinguished, and (3) the union of
    a family of distinguished subsets is distinguished. ⦉

  ‖ We call the elements of the topology the ❬open sets❭. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬topological space❭ is an ordered pair: a base set and a
    set distinguished subsets of the base set which are a
    topology. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $X$ be a non-empty set. ⦉

  ‖ For the set of distinguished sets, we tend to use $𝒯$, a
    mnemonic for topology, read aloud as “script T”. ⦉

  ‖ We tend to denote elements of $𝒯$ by $O$, a mnemonic for
    open. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the topological space with base set $X$ and
    topology $𝒯$ by $(X, 𝒯)$. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the properties satisfied by elements of $𝒯$:
    𝍫 ⦊
      ‣ $X, ∅ ∈ 𝒯$ ⦉

      ‣ if $O_1, …, O_n ∈ 𝒯$, then $⋂_{i = 1}^{n} O_i ∈ 𝒯$ ⦉

      ‣ if $O_α ∈ 𝒯$ for all $α ∈ I$, then $⋃_{α ∈ I} ∈ 𝒯$ ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

§ Examples ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ $𝗥$ with the open intervals as the open sets is a
    topological space. ⦉
