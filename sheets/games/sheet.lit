§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to discuss interactive decision making. ⦉
⦉

§ Discussion ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We are interested in talking about situations in which there
    are several ❬decision makers❭, ❬agents❭ or ❬players❭, each of
    which are making decisions that will affect the outcome for
    all involved. ⦉
⦉

§§ Example: rock paper scissors ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Consider the game “rock-paper-scissors” in which there are
    two players $A$ and $B$. ⦉

  ‖ Each player may choose one of the three actions ⸤Rock⸥,
    ⸤Paper⸥, ⸤Scissors⸥. ⦉

  ‖ To play, each player simultaneously selects an action, and
    these are compared. ⦉

  ‖ ❲% So far we have a set of ❬players❭ or ❬agents❭ $P = \set{A, B}$ and a set of actions $\set{⸤Rock⸥, ⸤Paper⸥, ⸤Scissors⸥}$.❳ ⦉

  ‖ Here, both agents have the same actions. ⦉

  ‖ ❲% In this case, both agents have the same set of actions, but they need not.❳ ⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ There is a finite set of ❬players❭, or ❬agents❭, or
    ❬controllers❭. ⦉

  ‖ Let $ℐ$ be a finite set with $\num{ℐ} = n$, the players. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ In rock-paper-scissors, for example, $ℐ = \set{A, B}$. ⦉

  ‖ There, each player could pick one of the three actions. ⦉

  ‖ Define $𝒜_A = 𝒜_B = \{$⸤Rock⸥, ⸤Paper⸥, ⸤Scissors⸥$\}$. ⦉

  ‖ We call $𝒜_A$ the actions of $A$ and $𝒜_B$ the actions of
    $B$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ We have a set of outcomes $\mathcal{O} = \{$⸤A Wins⸥, ⸤B
    Wins⸥, ⸤Tie⸥$\}$. ⦉

  ‖ Let $f: 𝒜_A ×C_B → \mathcal{O}$ defined by $f($⸤Rock⸥,
    ⸤Scissors⸥$) = $⸤A Wins⸥ ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The set of ❬players❭. ⦉

  ‖ Let $S$ be a finite set, the set of ❬states❭. ⦉

  ‖ For $i = 1, …, n$, let $\set{A^p_s}_{s ∈ S}$ be a family
    of sets, the ❬action sets by state❭. ⦉

  ‖ Define $𝒜^i = ∪_s A^p_s$ the set of ❬actions❭ for player
    $i = 1, …, n$. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $f: S × ∏_{i} 𝒜^i → S$, the ❬game dynamics❭ or
    ❬transition function❭. ⦉
