\section*{Why}

We want to generalize the construction of cover area as generated as a product of two cover lengths, and more generally for arbitrary measure spaces.\footnote{Future editions will expand.}

\section*{Definition}

The
\t{product measure}
of the measures of two
sigma finite measure spaces
is the unique measure
which assigns to every
rectangle with measurable
sides the product
of the measures of the sides.
We prove that such a measure exists,
and is unique.

\subsection*{Defining result}

\begin{proposition}
Suppose $(X, \mathcal{A} , \mu )$ and $(Y, \mathcal{B} , \nu )$ are sigma-finite measure spaces.
There is a unique measure $\pi $ on $\mathcal{A}  \times \mathcal{B} $ such that
\[
\pi (A \times  B) = \mu (A) \times  \nu (B) \quad \text{for all } A \in \mathcal{A}  \text{ and } B \in \mathcal{B}
\]
Furthermore, for any $E \in \mathcal{A}  \times  \mathcal{B} $.\footnote{Future editions will include a proof.}
\[
\pi (E) = \int _{X} \nu (E_x) d\mu (x) = \int _{Y} \mu (E^y)d\nu (y).
\]
\end{proposition}

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $(X, \mathcal{A} , \mu )$ and $(Y, \mathcal{B} , \nu )$ be sigma-finite measurable spaces.
We denote the product measure by $\mu  \times  \nu $.
For all $A \in \mathcal{A} $ and $B \in \mathcal{B} $,
\[
(\mu  \times  \nu )(A \times  B) = \mu (A) \times  \nu (B).
