§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to generalize the construction of cover area as
    generated as a product of two cover lengths, and more
    generally for arbitrary measure spaces.

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬product measure❭ of the measures of two sigma finite
    measure spaces is the unique measure which assigns to every
    rectangle with measurable sides the product of the measures
    of the sides. ⦉

  ‖ We prove that such a measure exists, and is unique. ⦉
⦉

§§ Defining result ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Suppose $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ and $(Y, ℬ, ν)$ are sigma-finite
    measure spaces. ⦉

  ‖ There is a unique measure $π$ on $𝒜 × ℬ$ such that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ π(A × B) = μ(A) × ν(B) \quad \text{for all } A ∈ 𝒜
        \text{ and } B ∈ ℬ ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Furthermore, for any $E ∈ 𝒜 × ℬ$.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will include a proof. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
  ◇ ⦊
    ‖ π(E) = ∫_{X} ν(E_x) dμ(x) = ∫_{Y} μ(E^y)dν(y). ⦉
  ⦉
</statement>

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ and $(Y, ℬ, ν)$ be sigma-finite measurable
    spaces. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the product measure by $μ × ν$. ⦉

  ‖ For all $A ∈ 𝒜$ and $B ∈ ℬ$,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ (μ × ν)(A × B) = μ(A) × ν(B). ⦉
