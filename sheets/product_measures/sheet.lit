§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to generalize the construction of cover area as
    generated as a product of two cover lengths, and more
    generally for arbitrary measure spaces.

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ⦉

  ‖ ❬product measure❭ ⦉

  ‖ of the measures of two ⦉

  ‖ sigma finite measure spaces ⦉

  ‖ is the unique measure ⦉

  ‖ which assigns to every ⦉

  ‖ rectangle with measurable ⦉

  ‖ sides the product ⦉

  ‖ of the measures of the sides. ⦉

  ‖ We prove that such a measure exists, ⦉

  ‖ and is unique. ⦉
⦉

§§ Defining result ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Suppose $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ and $(Y, ℬ, ν)$ are sigma-finite
    measure spaces. ⦉

  ‖ There is a unique measure $π$ on $𝒜 × ℬ$ such that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ π(A × B) = μ(A) × ν(B) \quad \text{for all } A ∈ 𝒜
        \text{ and } B ∈ ℬ ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ Furthermore, for any $E ∈ 𝒜 × ℬ$.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will include a proof. ⦉
    ⦉⦉
  ◇ ⦊
    ‖ π(E) = ∫_{X} ν(E_x) dμ(x) = ∫_{Y} μ(E^y)dν(y). ⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ and $(Y, ℬ, ν)$ be sigma-finite measurable
    spaces. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the product measure by $μ × ν$. ⦉

  ‖ For all $A ∈ 𝒜$ and $B ∈ ℬ$,
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ (μ × ν)(A × B) = μ(A) × ν(B). ⦉
