§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to generalize the construction of cover area as
    generated as a product of two cover lengths, and more
    generally for arbitrary measure spaces.

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ⦉

  ‖ ❬product measure❭ ⦉

  ‖ of the measures of two ⦉

  ‖ sigma finite measure spaces ⦉

  ‖ is the unique measure ⦉

  ‖ which assigns to every ⦉

  ‖ rectangle with measurable ⦉

  ‖ sides the product ⦉

  ‖ of the measures of the sides. ⦉

  ‖ We prove that such a measure exists, ⦉

  ‖ and is unique. ⦉

§§ Defining result ⦉
<statement type="proposition">
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ and $(Y, ℬ, ν)$ be sigma-finite
      measurable spaces. ⦉

    ‖ There is a unique measure $π$ on $𝒜 × ℬ$ such that
      ◇ ⦊
        ‖ π(A × B) = μ(A) × ν(B) ⦉
      ⦉
      for all $A ∈ 𝒜$ and $B ∈ ℬ$. ⦉

    ‖ Furthermore, for any $E ∈ 𝒜 × ℬ$.

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $(X, 𝒜, μ)$ and $(Y, ℬ, ν)$ be sigma-finite measurable
