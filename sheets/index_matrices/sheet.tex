\ssection{Definition}

An \t{index sequence} is a length $r$ sequence of distinct integers from $\upto{n}$, where $r \leq n$.
We call the $i$th coordinate of an index sequence (which is, itself, a natural number) the \t{$i$-index} of the sequence.
The \t{index matrix} associated with an index sequence is the $r \times n$ matrix whose $i,j$th entry is 1 if the index's $i$th entry is $j$, and $0$ otherwise.
If $r = n$ then the index matrix is a permutation matrix.

The product of an $r \times n$ index matrix with an $n$-vector is an $r$-vector whose $i$th entry is the $i$-index entry of the vector.
In other words, multiplying a vector by an index matrix produces a permuted subvector.

\ssubsection{Other Terminology}
Some authors use the term \t{index set} for index sequences; but since these are sequences (which are functions, and so relations, and so sets), they are not sets of indices, so we avoid this usage.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $r \leq n$ be natural numbers.
Let $\alpha: \upto{r} \to \upto{n}$ be an index sequence.
We denote the index matrix associated with $\alpha$ by $\IdxMat{\alpha}$.
This matrix $\IdxMat{\alpha}$ is an element of $\Mat{\N}{r}{n}$ and is defined by
$$
    (\IdxMat{\alpha})_{ij} = \begin{cases}
    1 & j = \alpha(i) \\
    0 & \ow
  \end{cases}
$$

Let $A$ be a nonempty set and let $x \in \Vec{A}{n}$.
then
$$
  P_{\alpha}x = \pmat{x_{\alpha(1)}, \dots, x_{\alpha(r)}}
$$
We denote the product $P_{\alpha}x$ by $x_{\alpha}$.
