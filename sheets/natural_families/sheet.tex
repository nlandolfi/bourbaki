\ssection{Why}

It is extremely
common to use
the first so
many natural numbers as
an index set.

\ssection{Definition}

A \ct{natural family}{}
of sets is a indexedkj family of sets
whose index set
is an subset of the
natural numbers smaller
than or equal to some
specified natural number.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $n$ be a natural
number.
Let $A$ be a non-empty
set.
Let $a: \set{1, \dots, n} \to \powerset{A}$
We often denote the family of $a$
by $A_1, \dots, A_n$.
We often say, \say{let $A_1, \dots, A_n$
be sets,} without any reference to
the fact that we are thinking of a family.
