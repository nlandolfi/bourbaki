\section*{Why}

Many things in real life are bounded and linear.\footnote{Future editions will expand on this weak explanation.}
More importantly, a bounded linear function between two norm spaces is continuous.
We will show this later.

\section*{Definition}

A \t{bounded linear transformation} between two norm spaces is a linear function which is bounded.
As with linear transformations, we sometimes call bounded linear transformations \t{bounded linear functions}.
Bounded linear functions are sometimes called \t{bounded operators}, since linear functions are sometimes called operators.
