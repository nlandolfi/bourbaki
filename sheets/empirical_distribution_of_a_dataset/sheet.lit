§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A natural distribution to associate with a dataset is to
    assign to each outcome a probability which reflects the
    number of times it appears in the dataset. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Given a dataset $x_1, …, x_n$ is a finite set $X$, the
    ❬empirical distribution❭ is the function $q: X → 𝗥$ which
    associates each outcome with the proportion of times it
    appears in the dataset. ⦉

  ‖ In other words, $q$ is defined by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ q(a) = \frac{1}{n} \num{\Set*{k ∈ \set{1, …, n}}{a^k =
        a}}. ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ The function $q$ is clearly a distribution, since the
    proportions are nonnegative and sum to one. ⦉
