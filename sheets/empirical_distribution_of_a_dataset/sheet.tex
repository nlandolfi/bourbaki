\section*{Why}

A natural distribution to associate with a dataset is to assign to each outcome a probability which reflects the number of times it appears in the dataset.

\section*{Definition}

Given a dataset $x_1, \dots , x_n$ is a finite set $X$, the \t{empirical distribution} is the function $q: X \to \R $ which associates each outcome with the proportion of times it appears in the dataset.
In other words, $q$ is defined by
\[
q(a) = \frac{1}{n} \num{\Set*{k \in \set{1, \dots , n}}{a^k = a}}.
\]
The function $q$ is clearly a distribution, since the proportions are nonnegative and sum to one.
