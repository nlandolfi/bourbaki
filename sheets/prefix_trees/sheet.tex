\ssection{Why}

\ssection{Definition}

Let $X$ and $A$ be finite sets and $c: X \to \strings(A)$.
The \t{maximum length} of a code is the length of the longest codeword.
We denote by $\strings^\ell(A)$ the strings of length smaller than $\ell$ in $A$.

The \t{prefix-tree} of depth $k$ corresponding to $c$ is the tree $(\CS^k(A),T)$ where $\set{s, t} \in E$ if $s$ is a prefix of $t$ and their lengths differ by one.

\begin{proposition}
If the code $c: X \to \CS(A)$ is prefix free, then no vertex in $c(X)$ is the ancestor of another vertex in $c(X)$.
\end{proposition}
