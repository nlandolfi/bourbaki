\ssection{Why}

We are given an object of some set, and want to find an element (in some subset) which is most similar to it.

\ssection{Definition}

Consider a non-empty set, one of its subsets, and a similarity function on it.
An \t{approximator} of an element of the set is any element of the subset.
So we call the subset the set of \t{approximators}.
One approximator may be more similar than another.
An \t{optimal} approximator is a minimizer of the similarity function over the set of approximators.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $A$ be a non-empty set.
Let $B \subset A$.
Let $d: A \times A \to \R$ be a similarity function.
If $a \in A$, any $b \in B$ is an approximator.
But an optimal approximator of $a$ is a solution of
$$
\begin{aligned}
  \text{ minimize }   & \quad d(a, b) \\
  \text{ subject to } & \quad b \in B.
\end{aligned}
$$
