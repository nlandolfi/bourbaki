§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ When we think of a matrix $A$ as giving a linear function,
    then we refer it is natural to speak of the ‹range› of the
    matrix when referencing the range of the function. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The range of a real matrix $A ∈ 𝗥^{m × n}$ is the range
    of the function $f: 𝗥^n → 𝗥^m$ defined by $f(x) = Ax$. ⦉

  ‖ The range is a subspace of $𝗥^n$. ⦉
