§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We want to associate elements of $𝗭$ with bitstrings for
    use on digital computers.
    † ⦊
      ‖ Future editions will discuss digital computers. ⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ A ❬digital integer❭ is a bit-string. ⦉

  ‖ The set of ❬$d$-bit integers❭ is the set of length-$d$ bit
    strings $\set{0, 1}^d$. ⦉

  ‖ For example, the set of 8-bit digital integers is the set
    $\set{0, 1}^8$. ⦉
⦉

§ Correspondence with $𝗭$ ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The bit string $x ∈ \set{0, 1}^d$ corresponds to the
    integer $∑_{i = 1}^{d} x_i 2^i$. ⦉
⦉

§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We denote the set of 8-bit (16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit) integers
    by ⁅int64⁆ (⁅int8⁆, ⁅int16⁆, ⁅int32⁆). ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ It is easy to embed $x$ in ⁅int8⁆ by considering $x'$ in
    ⁅int16⁆ defined by
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ x' = (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8, 0, 0,
        0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) ⦉
    ⦉

    ‖ In other words, we associate an 8-bit integer with a
      16-bit integer. ⦉⦉
  ¶ ⦊
    ‖ Naturally, we associate the integers with bit strings. ⦉
  ⦉

§ Signed integers ⦉
† ⦊
  ‖ Future editions will include an account of signed integers,
    or will place this in another sheet. ⦉
