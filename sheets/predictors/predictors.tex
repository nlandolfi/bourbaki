\ssection{Why}

We know the precept.
We want to know the postcept,
either earlier in time
or without looking elsewhere
in space.

\ssection{Definition}

A \ct{predictor}{} is a function from
precepts to postcepts.
For example,
if the prelation is presumptive,
then it is clear that we only
need the precepts, then the postcepts
are determined.
