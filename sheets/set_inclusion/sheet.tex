\ssection{Why}

We want language for all of the elements of a first set being the elements of a second set.

\ssection{Definition}

Denote a set by $A$ and a set by $B$.

\begin{definition}[Subsets]
If every element of the set denoted by $A$ is an element of the set denoted by $B$, then we say that the set denoted by $A$ is a \t{subset} of the set denoted by $B$.
\label{set_inclusion:subsets}
\end{definition}

We say that the set denoted by $A$ is \t{included} in the set denoted by $B$.
We say that the set denoted by $B$ is a \t{superset} of the set denoted by $A$ or that the set denoted by $B$ \t{includes} the set denoted by $A$.

Every set is included in and includes itself.

% \begin{caccount}
%   \cname{$A$};
%   \chave{}{$(\forall x)(x \in A \implies x \in A)$};
%   \cthus{}{$A \subset A$}{Def.}.
% \end{caccount}

% \begin{account}
% 	\name{$A$}
% 	\have{}{$(\forall x)(x \in A \implies x \in A)$}
% 	\thus{}{$A \subset A$}{Def~\ref{set_inclusion:subsets}}
% \end{account}

%If the sets denoted by $A$ and $B$ are identical, then each contains the other.
% \begin{account}[]
%   \namee{$A$}{$B$}
%   \have{}{$A = B$}
%   \thus{}{$(\forall x)(x \in A \implies x \in B)$}
%   \thus{}{$(\forall x)(x \in B \implies x \in A)$}
% \end{account}
% are identical
%If $A = B$, then the set denoted by $A$ includes the set denoted by $B$ and the set denoted by $B$ includes the set denoted by $A$.
%The axiom of extension asserts the converse also holds.
%If the set denoted by $A$ includes the set denoted by $B$ and the set denoted by$B$ includes the set denoted by $A$, then $A$ and $B$ denote the same set.
%% I$A = B$.
%In other words, if the set denoted by $A$ is a subset of the set denoted by $B$ and the set denoted by $B$ a subset of the set denoted by $A$, then $A = B$.
%
%The empty set is a subset of every other set.
%
%\begin{account}[Empty Set Inclusion]
%\namee{$A$}{$\emptyset$}
%\have{set_inclusion:empty:definition}{$\neg((\exists x)(x \in \emptyset))$}
%\thus{set_inclusion:empty:implication}{$(\forall x)((x \in \varnothing) \implies (x \in A))$}{\ref{set_inclusion:empty:definition}}
%\ie{set_inclusion:empty:conclusion}{$\varnothing \subset A$}{\ref{set_inclusion:empty:implication}}
%\end{account}
%
%Suppose toward contradiction that $A$ were a set which did not include the empty set.
%Then there would exist an element in the empty set which is not in $A$.
%But then the empty set would not be empty.
%We call the empty set and $A$ \t{improper subsets} of $A$.
%All other subsets we call \t{proper subsets}.
%In other words, $B$ is an improper subset of $A$ if and only if $A$ includes $B$, $B \neq A$ and $B \neq \emptyset$.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $A$ denote a set and $B$ denote a set.
We denote that the set $A$ is included in the set $B$ by $A \subset B$.
In other words, $A \subset B$ means $(\forall x)((x \in A) \implies (x \in B))$.
We read the notation $A \subset B$ aloud as \say{A is included in B} or \say{A subset B}.
Or we write $B \supset A$, and read it aloud \say{B includes A} or \say{B superset $A$}.
$B \supset A$ also means $(\forall x)((x \in A) \implies (x \in B))$.

\ssubsection{Properties}
% TODO(next edition): fix and expand this.

There are some properties that our intuition suggests inclusion should have.
First, every set should include itself.
We describe this fact by saying that inclusion is \t{reflexive}.
\begin{proposition}[Reflexive]
  Every set is included in itself
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
\begin{caccount}
  \cname{$A$};
  \chave{}{$(\forall x)(x \in A \implies x \in A)$};
  \cthus{}{$A \subset A$}{Definition~\ref{set_inclusion:subsets}}.
\end{caccount}
\end{proof}

Next, we expect that if one set is included in another,
This fact is described by saying that inclusion is \t{transitive}
\begin{proposition}[Transitive]
  If a set is included in another, and the latter in yet another, then the first is included in the last.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
\begin{caccount}
  \cname{$A, B, C$};
  \chave{}{$A \subset B$}
  \chave{}{$B \subset C$}
  \cthus{}{$A \subset C$}{modus ponens}.
\end{caccount}
\end{proof}
%TODO(next edition): define modus ponens!

Equality $(=)$ shares these two properties.
Let $A$ denote an object.
Then $A = A$.
Let $B$ and $C$ also denote objects.
If $A = B$ and $B = C$, then $A = C$.
Of course, inclusion is not symmetric..
Belonging ($\in)$ may be, but need not be reflexive and transitive.

% If $A \subset B$ and $B \subset A$, then $A = B$ (by the axiom of extension).

% \ssubsection{Comparison with belonging}
%
% Given a set $A$ inclusion is reflexive.
% $A \subset A$ is always true.
% $A \in A$ may be true.
% %Is $A \in A$ ever true?
% Inclusion is transitive, whereas belonging is not.
