§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Can we combine sets? ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We say yes. ⦉

  ‖ For example, if we have a first set denoted $A$ and a
    second set denoted $B$, then we want a third set including
    all the elements of the set denoted by $A$ and the elements
    of the set denoted by $B$. ⦉

  ‖ If an object appears in the set denoted by $A$ and in the
    set denoted by $B$, it appears in the new set. ⦉

  ‖ If an object appears in one set but not the other, it
    appears in the new set. ⦉

  ‖ Indeed, if we have a set of sets, the same should hold. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  <statement type='principle' text='Union'>
    ‖ Given a set of sets, there exists a set which contains
      all elements which belong to any of the sets. ⦉
  </statement>

  ‖ We call this the ❬principle of union❭. ⦉

  ‖ If we have one set and another, the axiom of unions says
    that there exists a set which contains all the elements that
    belong to at least one of the former or the latter. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ The set guaranteed by the principle of union may contain
    more elements than just those which are elements of a member
    of the the given set of sets. ⦉

  ‖ No matter: apply the axiom of specification (see
    \sheetref{set_specification}{Set Specification}) to form the set
    which contains only those elements which are appear in at
    least one of any of the sets. ⦉

  ‖ The set is unique by the principle of extension. ⦉

  ‖ We call that unique set ❬the union❭ of the sets. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $𝒜$ be a set of sets. ⦉

  ‖ We denote the union of $𝒜$ by $\bigcup 𝒜$. ⦉

  ‖ So
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ (∀ x)((x ∈ (∪ 𝒜)) \iff (∃ A)((A ∈ 𝒜) \land x ∈ A)). ⦉
    ⦉⦉
⦉

§ Simple facts ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ It is reasonable for the union of the empty set to be
    empty and for the union of the singleton of a set to be
    itself.
