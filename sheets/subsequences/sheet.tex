\ssection{Why}
We want to select particular terms of sequence.

\ssection{Definition}
A \t{subindex} is a monotonically increasing function from and to the natural numbers.
Roughly, it selects some ordered infinite subset of natural numbers.
A \t{subsequence} of a first sequence is any second sequence which is the composition of the first sequence with a subindex.

\ssection{Notation}

Let $i: \N  \to \N $ such that $n < m \Rightarrow i(n) < i(m)$.
Then $i$ is a subindex.
Let $b = a \comp i$.
Then $b$ is a subsequence of $a$.
We denote it by $\set{b_{i(n)}}_n$ and the $n$th term by $b_{i(n)}$.
