§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊

  ‖ We want to select particular terms of sequence. ⦉

  ‖ \ssection{Definition} ⦉

  ‖ A ❬subindex❭ is a monotonically increasing function from and
    to the natural numbers. ⦉

  ‖ Roughly, it selects some ordered infinite subset of natural
    numbers. ⦉

  ‖ A ❬subsequence❭ of a first sequence is any second sequence
    which is the composition of the first sequence with a
    subindex. ⦉

⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $i: 𝗡 → 𝗡$ such that $n < m ⇒ i(n) < i(m)$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $i$ is a subindex. ⦉

  ‖ Let $b = a \comp i$. ⦉

  ‖ Then $b$ is a subsequence of $a$. ⦉

  ‖ We denote it by $\set{b_{i(n)}}_n$ and the $n$th term by
    $b_{i(n)}$. ⦉
