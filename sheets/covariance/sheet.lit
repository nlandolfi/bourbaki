§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬covariance❭ between two random variables which are each
    integrable and whose product is integrable is the expectation
    of their product less the product of their expectation. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $f$ and $g$ be two integrable random variables with
    $fg$ integrable. ⦉

  ‖ Denote the covariance of $f$ with $g$ by $\cov(f, g)$. ⦉

  ‖ We defined it:
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \cov(f, g) = 𝗘(fg) - 𝗘(f)𝗘(g). ⦉

§§ Properties ⦉

  ‖ \begin{prop} ⦉

  ‖ Covariance is symmetric and billinear.

  ‖ \begin{prop} ⦉

  ‖ The covariance of a random variable with itself is its
    variance. ⦉

  ‖ \begin{proof} ⦉

  ‖ Let $f$ be a square-integrable real-valued random variable,
    then
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \cov(f, f) = 𝗘(ff) - 𝗘(f)𝗘(f) = 𝗘(f^2) - (𝗘(f))^2
        = \var(f). ⦉

  ‖ sum of integrable ⦉

  ‖ real-valued random variables ⦉

  ‖ whose pairwise products ⦉

  ‖ are integrable ⦉

  ‖ is the double sum of ⦉

  ‖ the pairwise covariances. ⦉

  ‖ \begin{proof} ⦉

  ‖ Let $f_1, …, f_n$ be integrable random variables with
    $f_if_j$ integrable for all $i,j = 1, …, n$. ⦉
