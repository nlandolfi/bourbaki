§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ The ❬covariance❭ between two random variables which are each
    integrable and whose product is integrable is the expectation
    of their product less the product of their expectation. ⦉
⦉

§§ Notation ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Let $f$ and $g$ be two integrable random variables with
    $fg$ integrable. ⦉

  ‖ Denote the covariance of $f$ with $g$ by $\cov(f, g)$. ⦉

  ‖ We defined it:
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \cov(f, g) = 𝗘(fg) - 𝗘(f)𝗘(g). ⦉

§§ Properties ⦉
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ Covariance is symmetric and billinear. ⦉
</statement>
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ The covariance of a random variable with itself is its
    variance. ⦉
</statement>
<proof>
  ‖ Let $f$ be a square-integrable real-valued random variable,
    then
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ \cov(f, f) = 𝗘(ff) - 𝗘(f)𝗘(f) = 𝗘(f^2) - (𝗘(f))^2 =
        \var(f). ⦉
    ⦉⦉
</proof>
<statement type='proposition'>
  ‖ The variance of a sum of integrable real-valued random
    variables whose pairwise products are integrable is the double
    sum of the pairwise covariances. ⦉
</statement>
<proof>
  ‖ Let $f_1, …, f_n$ be integrable random variables with
    $f_if_j$ integrable for all $i,j = 1, …, n$. ⦉

  ‖ Using the billinearity,
    ◇ ⦊

      ‖ ＆= \cov(∑_{i = 1}^{n} f_i, ∑_{i = 1}^{n}f_i) ᜶ ⦉

      ‖ ＆= ∑_{i = 1}^{n} ∑_{j = 1}^{n} \cov(f_i, f_j) ⦉
