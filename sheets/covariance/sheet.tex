\section*{Definition}

The \t{covariance} between two random variables which are each integrable and whose product is integrable is the expectation of their product less the product of their expectation.

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $f$ and $g$ be two integrable random variables with $fg$ integrable.
Denote the covariance of $f$ with $g$ by $\cov(f, g)$.
We defined it:
\[
\cov(f, g) = \E (fg) - \E (f)\E (g).
\]

\subsection*{Properties}

\begin{proposition}
Covariance is symmetric and billinear.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
The covariance of a random variable with itself is its variance.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}Let $f$ be a square-integrable real-valued random variable, then
\[
\cov(f, f) = \E (ff) - \E (f)\E (f) = \E (f^2) - (\E (f))^2 = \var(f).
\]\end{proof}
\begin{proposition}
The variance of a sum of integrable real-valued random variables whose pairwise products are integrable is the double sum of the pairwise covariances.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}Let $f_1, \dots , f_n$ be integrable random variables with $f_if_j$ integrable for all $i,j = 1, \dots , n$.
Using the billinearity,
\[
\begin{aligned}
\textstyle \var \sum_{i = 1}^{n} f_i
&= \cov(\sum_{i = 1}^{n} f_i, \sum_{i = 1}^{n}f_i) \\
&= \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \sum_{j = 1}^{n} \cov(f_i, f_j)
\end{aligned}
\]\end{proof}
