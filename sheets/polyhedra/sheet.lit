§ Why ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ We generalize real polyhedra to arbitrary inner product
    spaces. ⦉
⦉

§ Definition ⦉
¶ ⦊
  ‖ Suppose $X$ is a vector space with an inner product
    $\ip{·,·}$ over $𝗥$. ⦉

  ‖ A set $P ⊂ X$ is a ❬polyhedron❭ (called a ❬polyhedral
    set❭) if there exists $c_1, …, c_m ∈ X$ and $α_1, …, α_m
    ∈ 𝗥$ so that
    ◇ ⦊
      ‖ P = \Set{x ∈ X}{\ip{x, c_i} ≤ α_i \text{ for } i =
        1, …, m} ⦉
    ⦉⦉

  ‖ In other words, if the set can be described by finitely
    many inequalities. ⦉
⦉

¶ ⦊
  ‖ As before, a polyhedron is a ❬polytope❭ if it is bounded. ⦉
