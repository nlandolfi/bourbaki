\stitle{Cartesian Products}

\ssection{Why}

We want to handle objects composed of elements from different sets.

\ssection{Definition}

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets.
Construct a new set that is the ordered pairs of elements of $A$ and $B$: the first element of the pair is an element of $A$ and the second element of the pair is an element of $B$.
The \definition{cartesian product} of $A$ with $B$ is the set of all such ordered pairs.

We call an ordered pair \definition{tuple}.
Two tuples are equal if they have equal elements in the same order.
Because of the ordering, if $A \neq B$, the cartesian product of $A$ with $B$ is not the same as the cartesian product of $B$ with $A$.
Only in the case that $A = B$ does this symmetry hold.

\ssubsection{Notation}
For sets $A$ and $B$ we denote the cartesian product of $A$ with $B$ by $A \cross B$.
We read the notation $A \cross B$ as \say{A cross B.}
We denote elements of $A \cross B$ by $(a, b)$ with the understanding that $a \in A$ and $b \in B$.
In this notation, we can write the observation that $A \cross B \neq B \cross A$, unless $A = B$.
