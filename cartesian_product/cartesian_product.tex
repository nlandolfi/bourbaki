\stitle{Ordered Pairs}

\ssection{Why}

We want to handle \rt{objects}{object}
composed of \rt{elements}{element} from
different \rt{sets}{set}.

\ssection{Definition}

Let $A$ and $B$ be \rt{sets}{set}.
An ordered pair of a first element a the set of two
Construct a new \rt{set}{set} that is the
ordered pairs of \rt{elements of}{element}
$A$ and $B$: the first \rt{element}{element}
of the pair is an \rt{element}{element} of
$A$ and the second \rt{element}{element} of
the pair is an \rt{element of}{element} $B$.
The \ct{cartesian product}{cartesianproduct}
of $A$ with $B$ is the \rt{set}{set} of all
such ordered pairs.

We call an ordered pair \ct{tuple}{tuple}.
Two tuples are equal if they have equal elements in the same order.
Because of the ordering, if $A \neq B$, the cartesian product of $A$ with $B$
is not the same as the cartesian product of $B$ with $A$.
Only in the case that $A = B$ does this symmetry hold.

\ssubsection{Notation}
For sets $A$ and $B$ we denote the cartesian product of
$A$ with $B$ by $A \cross B$.
We read the notation $A \cross B$ as \say{A cross B.}
We denote elements of $A \cross B$ by $(a, b)$ with the
understanding that $a \in A$ and $b \in B$.
In this notation, we can write the observation that
$A \cross B \neq B \cross A$, unless $A = B$.
