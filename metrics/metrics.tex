\ssection{Why}

We want to talk about a set
with a prescribed quantitative
degree of closeness (or distance)
between its elements.

\ssection{Definition}

The correspondences
which serve as a
degree of closeness,
or measure of distance, must
satisify our notions of distances
previously developed.

A function on ordered pairs which
does not depend on the order of
the elements so considered is
\ct{symmetric}{symmetricfunction}.
A function to the real numbers
which takes only non-negative
values is \ct{non-negative}{nonnegativefunction}.
A repeated pair is an ordered pair
of the same element twice.
A function which satisfies
a triangle inequality for any
three elements is
\ct{triangularly transitive}{triangularlytransitivefunction}.

A \ct{metric}{metric}
(or \ct{distance function}{distancefunction})
is a function
on ordered pairs of elements
of a set which
is symmetric, non-negative,
zero only on repeated pairs,
and triangularly
transitive.
A \ct{metric space}{metric space}
is an ordered
pair: a set with
a metric on the set.

In a metric space,
we say that one pair
of objects is \ct{closer}{closer}
together if
the metric
of the first pair
is smaller than the
metric value of the
second pair.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $A$ be a set
and let $R$ be the set
of real numbers.
We commonly denote
a metric by the letter
$d$, as a mnemonic
for \say{distance.}
Let $d: A \times A \to R$.
Then $d$ is a metric if:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    it is non-negative,
    which we tend to denote by
    $$
      d(a, b) \geq 0, \quad \forall a,b \in A.
    $$
    %We read this notation as:
    %\say{the distance between
    %a and b is at least zero}
  \item
    it is $0$ only on repeated pairs, which we tend to denote
    by
    $$
      d(a, b) = 0 \Leftrightarrow a = b, \quad \forall a,b \in A.
    $$

%    We read this notation as:
%    \say{the distance between
%    two objects is zero
%    a and b is at least zero}
  \item
    it is symmetric, which we tend to denote by:
    $$
      d(a, b) = d(b, a), \quad \forall a,b \in A.
    $$
  \item
    it is triangularly transitive, which we tend to
    denote by
    $$
      d(a, b) \leq d(a, c) + d(c, b), \quad \forall a,b,c \in A.
    $$
\end{enumerate}
As usual, we denote the metric space
of $A$ with $d$ by
$(A, d)$.
