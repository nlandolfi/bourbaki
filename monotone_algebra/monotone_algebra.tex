\stitle{Monotone Algebra}

\ssection{Why}

If an algebra is also
a monotone class,
it is a sigma algebra.
Closure under monotone limits
is a weaker
condition than that included
in the definition of sigma
algebras.

\ssection{Result}

\begin{prop}

Let $A$ a non-empty set and
$\mathcal{A}$ an algebra on $A$.
$\mathcal{A}$ is a sigma algebra
if either
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  the limit of a nondecreasing
  sequence of distinguished sets
  is distinguished

  \item
  the limit of a nonincreasing
  sequence of distinguished sets
  is distinguished.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{proof}
TODO
\end{proof}

\end{prop}
