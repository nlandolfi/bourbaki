\stitle{Monotone Algebra}

\ssection{Why}

Closure under monotone limits
is a weaker
condition than that included
in the definition of sigma
algebras, but is
sufficient if the set is
also an algebra.
TODO: why

\ssection{Result}

If a subset algebra
is a monotone space, then
it is a countably summable
subset algebra.


\begin{prop}

A subset algebra is
a countably summable
if either:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  the limit of a nondecreasing
  sequence of distinguished sets
  is distinguished

  \item
  the limit of a nonincreasing
  sequence of distinguished sets
  is distinguished.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{proof}
TODO
\end{proof}

\end{prop}
