\stitle{Objects}

\ssection{Why}

We want to talk about things.

\ssection{Definition}

We use the word \ct{object}{object}
with its usual sense in the English
language.
An object may be tangible, in that
we can hold or touch it,
or an object may be abstract,
in that we can do neither.

\ssubsection{Notation}

To aid in discussing and
denoting objects, let
us tend to give them
short names.
A single Latin
letter regularly suffices:
for example,
$a$, $b$ or $c$.
To aid our memory,
we tend to choose the
letter mnemonically.

We denote that
the object $a$ and
the object $b$ are
the same object
by $a = b$,
read aloud as
\say{a is b.}
We denote that
the object $a$ and
$b$ are different
by $a \neq b$,
 read aloud as
\say{a is not b.}
