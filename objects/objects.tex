\stitle{Objects}

\ssection{Why}

We want to talk about things.

\ssection{Definition}

We use the word \ct{object}{object}
with its usual sense in the English
language.
An object may be tangible, in that
we can hold or touch it,
or an object may be abstract,
in that we can do neither.

Let us assume that we can
identify objects.
In particular, let us assume
that we have, as a primitive
notion, the ability
to distinguish objects.
If we can not distinguish
two objects, then they are
the same.

\ssubsection{Notation}

To aid in discussing and
denoting objects, let
us tend to give them
short names.
A single Latin
letter regularly suffices:
for example,
$a$, $b$ or $c$.
Let us denote that
the object $a$ and
the object $b$ are
the same object
by $a = b$,
read aloud as
\say{a is b.}
