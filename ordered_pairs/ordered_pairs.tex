\stitle{Ordered Pairs}

\ssection{Why}

We speak of
\rt{objects}{object}
composed of
\rt{elements}{element}
from different
\rt{sets}{set}.

\ssection{Definition}

Let $A$ and $B$ be
non-empty
\rt{sets}{set}.
Let $a \in A$ and
$b \in B$.
An
\ct{ordered pair}{pair}
is the set
$\set{\set{a}, \set{a, b}}$.
The
\ct{cartesian product}{cartesianproduct}
of $A$ and $B$ is the set
of all ordered pairs.

We observe that two pairs
are equal if they have equal
elements in the same order.
The ordered causes
If $A \neq B$,
the ordering causes
the cartesian product of
$A$ and $B$
to differ from
the cartesian product of
$B$ with $A$.
If $A = B$, however, the
symmetry holds.

\ssubsection{Notation}
We denote the ordered pair
$\set{\set{a},\set{a,b}}$
by $(a, b)$.
We denote the caresian product
of $A$ with $B$ by
$A \cross B$, read aloud as
\say{A cross B.}
We record succinctly:
 if $A \neq B$, then
$A \cross B \neq B \cross A$.
