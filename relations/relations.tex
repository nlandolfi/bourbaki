\title{Relations}

\section{Why}
We want to speak of elements of one set in relation to elements of another set.

\section{Definition}

A \definition{relation} between two non-empty \term{sets}{sets} $A$ and $B$ is a subset of $A \cross B$.
So then, naturally, a relation on a single set $C$ is a subset of $C \cross C$.

\subsection{Notation}
As relations are sets, our de facto protocol is to denote them by upper case capital letters, for example, the letter $R$.
Let $R$ a relation on $A$ and $B$.
If $(a, b) \in R$, we often write $a R b$, read aloud as \say{a in relation $R$ to b.}

In many cases, though, we forego the set notation and use particular symbols.
Often the symbols we use are meant to be suggestive of the relation.
Some examples include $\sim$, $=$, $<$, $\leq$, $\prec$, and $\preceq$.
