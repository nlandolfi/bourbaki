\stitle{Relations}

\ssection{Why}

We regularly define
relations on a single
set.

\ssection{Definition}

A
\definition{relation}{relation}
between two non-empty
\term{sets}{sets}
$A$ and $B$ is a subset of
$A \cross B$.
A relation on a single set
$C$ is a subset of $C \cross C$.

We distinguish the order
of the elements for
the relation.
This distinction is obvious
when the relation is between
two different sets.
When it is between the same set,
however, this distinction
is subtle.

\ssubsection{Notation}
We denote relations with upper
case capital latin letters because
they are sets.
Let $R$ be a relation on $A$ and $B$.
We denote that $(a, b) \in R$ by
$a R b$, read aloud as
\say{a in relation $R$ to b.}

Often, instead of latin letters we use
other symbols.
For example,
$\sim$, $=$, $<$,
$\leq$, $\prec$, and $\preceq$.
