\ssection{Why}

We want a model
of uncertain events.

\ssection{Definition}

A
\ct{probability measure}
is a measure
which assigns
1 to the whole space.
So probability measures
are finite measures.
Since, any finite measure
can be scaled to a
a probability measure,
a probability measure
is an exembplare of
finite measures.

A
\ct{probability space}{probabilityspace}
is a measure space
whose measure is a
probability measure.

\ssubsection{Notation}

We denote the
outcome space by
$\Omega$,
a mnemonic for
\say{outcomes.}
We denote the
sigma-algebra by
$\SA$,
as usual.
We denote a probability
measure
by $\pmeas$, a mnemonic
for \say{probability.}
Thus, we often say
\say{Let
$(\Omega, \SA, \pmeas)$
be a probability space.}
