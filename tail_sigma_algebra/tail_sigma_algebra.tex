\stitle{Tail Sigma Algebra}

\ssection{Why}

\ssection{Definition}

The \ct{tail sigma algebra}{}
of a sequence of random variables
is the sigma algebra which is
the intersection of the sigma
algebras of all final
parts of the sequence.

\ssubsection{Notation}

Let $\seq{f}$ be a sequence
of random variables.
Denote the tail
sigma algebra by
$T(\seq{f})$.
We defined it as:
\[
  T(\seq{f}) = \intersection_{n = 1}^{\infty} \sigma(\set{X_{n+k}}_k).
\]
