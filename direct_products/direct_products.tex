\section{Why}

We can profitably generalize the notion of cartesian product to families of sets indexed by the natural numbers.

\section{Direct Products}

We define the \definition{direct product} of family indexed by the naturals as the set whose elements are finite ordered sequences of elements from each set in the family.
The ordering on the sequences comes from the natural ordering on $n$.
We call the elements of this product \definition{$n$-tuples}.
Further generalizing to an infinite family, we can take the indexing set to be the set of natural numbers.
We definie the direct product in this case to be the set whose elements are ordered infinite sequences of elements from each set in teh ordered infinite sequence of sets.
If all the the sets in the family are the same single set, we call the elements of the direct product the \definition{sequences} in that single set.


For a family $\set{A_{\alpha}}_{\alpha \in I}$ of $S$ with $I = \set{1, \dots, n}$, we denote the direct product by
\[
  \product_{i = 1}^{n} A_{i}.
\]
We read this notation as \say{product over alpha in I of A sub-alpha.}
We denote an element of $\product_{i = 1}^{n} A_{i}$ by $(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n)$ with the understanding that $a_1 \in A_1, a_2 \in A_2, \dots, a_n \in A_n$.

If $I$ is the set of natural numbers we denote the direct product by
\[
  \product_{i = 1}^{\infty} A_{i}.
\]
We denote an element of $\product_{i = 1}^{\infty} A_{i}$ by $(a_i)$ with the understanding that $a_i \in A_i$ for all $i = 1,2,3,\dots$.
If $A_i = A$ for all $i = 1, 2, 3,\dots$, then $(a_i)$ is a sequence in $A$.
