\section{Why}

Counting one by one is slow so we define an algebra on the naturals.

\section{Sums and Addition}

Let $m$ and $n$ be two natural numbers.
If we apply the successor function to $m$ $n$ times we obtain a number.
If we apply the successor function to $n$ $m$ times we obtain a number.
Indeed, we obtain the same number in both cases.
We call this number the \definition{sum} of $m$ and $n$.
We say we \definition{add} $m$ to $n$, or vice versa.
We call this symmetric operation mapping $(m, n)$ to their sum \definition{addition}.

\subsection{Notation}

We denote the operation of addition by $+$ and so denote the sum of the naturals $m$ and $n$ by $m + n$.

\section{Products and Multiplication}

Let $m$ and $n$ naturals.
If we add $n$ copies of $m$ we obtain a number.
If we add $m$ copies of $n$ we obtain a number.
Indeed, we obtain the same number in both cases.
We call this number the \definition{product} of $m$ and $n$.
We say we \definition{multiply} $m$ to $n$, or vice versa.
We call this symmetric operation mapping $(m, n)$ to their product \definition{multiplication}.

\subsection{Notation}

We denote the operation of multiplication by $\cdot$ and so denote the product of the naturals $m$ and $n$ by $m \cdot n$.
